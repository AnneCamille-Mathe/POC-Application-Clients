<h3 id="the-wikitude-native-sdk-augmented-reality-for-your-own-app">The Wikitude Native SDK - Augmented Reality for your own app</h3>
<p>The Wikitude Native SDK is a software library and framework for mobile apps used to create augmented reality experiences. The Native SDK supports use cases which require image recognition and tracking technology (vision based augmented reality).</p>
<p>To use the Wikitude Native SDK within a Unity project, simply import the Wikitude.unitypackage into a existing Unity project and import all assets that are part of the .unitypackage. After the import is done, use the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> prefab in combination with one of the <code>Tracker</code> prefabs.</p>
<h3 id="architecture-of-the-wikitude-sdk">Architecture of the Wikitude SDK</h3>
<p><img src="images/sdk8_architecture.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The image above shows the different components of the Wikitude SDK and possible approaches for creating augmented reality apps. Each of these approaches is based on certain development environments (IDE) and platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computer Vision Engine:</strong> The computer vision engine is part of the core component of the Wikitude SDK and used by all platforms. It includes three major parts in its own: <strong>SLAM Engine</strong>, <strong>Image Recognition Engine</strong> and the <strong>Object Recognition engine</strong>. The CV Engine is not directly accessible but wrapped either by the Native API (Java, ObjC) or the JavaScript API.</li>
<li><strong>Wikitude SDK  - Native API:</strong> Provides access to the Wikitude computer vision engine natively for Android (Java), iOS (ObjC) and Windows UWP. It also can load plugins via the Wikitude Plugins API. </li>

<h2 id="setup-guide-unity-plugin">Setup Guide Unity Plugin</h2>
<p>There are only a few steps necessary to add the Wikitude Unity Plugin to your existing Unity project. This guide will explain them in detail.
In general the steps are</p>
<ul>
<li>Import the Wikitude.unitypackage into your project</li>
<li>Add the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> and one of the <code>Tracker</code> prefabs to the Unity scene hierarchy and configure their properties</li>
<li>Add a custom augmentation to the tracker as child GameObject to the <code>Trackable</code></li>
<li>Export your project in order to fully integrate the Wikitude API in your Unity project</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="import-the-wikitude-unitypackage">Import the Wikitude.unitypackage</h3>
<p>The Wikitude Unity Plugin comes as a standard .unitypackage and can be imported through the usual Unity package import procedure.
In your Unity project, open the <code>Assets</code> dropdown menu and choose <code>Import Package -&gt; Custom Package</code>.
<img src="images/unity_import_package_menu.png" alt="">
Select the downloaded Wikitude.unitypackage in the presented open file browser and click <code>open</code>. You should import all items that are part of the Wikitude.unitypackage.
<img src="images/unity_import_package_button.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="use-the-wikitude-unity-plugin">Use the Wikitude Unity plugin</h3>
<p>After the Wikitude.unitypackage was imported, its components and scripts can be used to define a custom augmented reality experience. The <a href="sampleunity.html">example section</a> describes in more detail how those prefabs and scripts can be used to do so.</p>
<h3 id="export-and-xcode-build-settings-changes">Export and Xcode Build Settings Changes</h3>
<p>Once the application is setup in Unity and ready for testing on a real device, it needs to be exported as an Xcode project for iOS, Android Studio project for Android, or Visual Studio project for UWP. Alternatively, for Android you can build the .apk directly from Unity.</p>
<h4 id="export-to-xcode">Export to Xcode</h4>
<p>iOS developers need to open the exported project and manually do the steps listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before exporting, make sure the <code>Target minimum iOS version</code> is set to 9.0 or later and <code>Camera Usage Description</code> is set to an appropriate message in the Unity in Player Settings. These settings can also be done in the Xcode project, but setting them in Unity will ensure it they don&#39;t get overwritten when rebuilding your project.</li>
<li>After the Xcode project was exported, the <code>WikitudeSDK</code> framework has to be added as an <code>Embedded Binary</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these steps are done once, building with <code>Append</code> or by pressing <code>Cmd + B</code> will ensure that the settings are kept.</p>
<h4 id="export-an-apk-file">Export an .apk file</h4>
<p>If you don&#39;t need an Android Studio project, building directly from Unity is the fastest way to run your app on an Android device.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Unity open <code>File | Build Settings...</code>
<img src="images/unity_build_settings_menu.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Make sure <code>Android</code> is the current build target. If not, select <code>Android</code> from the list and click <code>Switch Platform</code></li>
<li>Click <code>Build And Run</code> and choose where to save the .apk file. If you have an Android device connected, it will also install the app on it.
<img src="images/unity_build_settings_run.png" alt=""></li>
</ol>
<p>After this is done once, pressing <code>Ctrl + B</code> (Windows) or <code>Cmd + B</code> (Mac) will automatically create the .apk file and install it on your device, if it is connected.</p>
<h4 id="export-to-android-studio">Export to Android Studio</h4>
<ol>
<li>In Unity open <code>File | Build Settings...</code>, check <code>Export Project</code> and click <code>Export</code>
<img src="images/unity_build_settings_export.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Ensure the project folder contains no space, otherwise you will have troubles deploying the project.</li>
<li>Open Android Studio and click <code>Open an existing Android Studio project</code>
<img src="images/unity_android_import.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Within the file selection dialog, navigate to the folder where you exported the project and select the folder named after your app.</li>
<li>Android Studio may ask you to upgrade gradle, accept.</li>
<li>Android Studio may complain about <code>minSdk version</code> and <code>targetSdk version</code> being set. Remove the line from the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> ( <code>&lt;uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion=&quot;19&quot; android:targetSdkVersion=&quot;24&quot; /&gt;</code>), and re-run gradle.</li>
<li>The project is now running in Android Studio</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="export-to-visual-studio">Export to Visual Studio</h4>
<p>When building for UWP, the following settings need to be enabled to make sure that the SDK is compatible with Unity.</p>
<p>From the Build Settings menu, please make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Target Device</code> is set to <code>PC</code></li>
<li><code>Build Type</code> is set to <code>D3D</code></li>
<li><code>Build and Run on</code> is set to <code>Local Machine</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, from the Player Settings -&gt; Other Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Graphics APIs</code> is set to <code>Direct3D11</code></li>
<li><code>Scripting Backend</code> is set to <code>IL2CPP</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And from Player Settings -&gt; Publishing Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Capabilities</code> has <code>InternetClient</code> and <code>WebCam</code> enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the project can be exported to Visual Studio. Once the project is exported, you can build the project for <code>x64</code>.</p>

<h2 id="license-key">License Key</h2>
<p>The Wikitude SDK requires a valid license key to be able to run properly. An empty or missing license key will block the augmented reality view from showing any meaningful content. You will see a watermark across the screen with the words <code>License Key Missing</code>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-obtain-a-free-trial-license">How to obtain a free trial license</h3>
<p>When downloading the Wikitude SDK you will be forwarded to the <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/developer/licenses">license generation page</a>, where a trial license key is automatically generated for you. </p>
<p><img src="images/trial_key_license_page.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Copy the key into your app, which will unlock the trial mode of the Wikitude SDK. The trial mode of the Wikitude SDK contains the full feature set of the Wikitude SDK but will show a <code>Trial</code> watermark across the screen.</p>
<p>Each trial license key is valid for every application ID on every operating system. You can use the same trial license key in multiple apps. </p>
<h3 id="where-should-i-enter-the-license-key">Where should I enter the license key</h3>
<h3 id="unity-plugin">Unity Plugin</h3>
<p>To use the Wikitude Unity Plugin with a certain license key, paste your license key into the text field of the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> prefab.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_license_key_field.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Also, please make sure that the <code>Bundle Identifer</code> is correctly set and matches the one used to generate the license key.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_bundle_identifier.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When developing for the UWP platform, the <code>Bundle Identifier</code> should be set in the <code>Package Name</code> field of the <code>Publishing Settings</code> tab.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_package_name_uwp.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="ios-app-store-submissions">iOS App Store submissions</h2>
<h3 id="removing-simulator-architectures">Removing simulator architectures</h3>
<p>To work around an Xcode <a href='http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216' target='_blank'>App Store submission bug</a>, the WikitudeNativeSDK.framework contains a shell script that removes the simulator architectures from the .framework. This script can either be run from the <code>Terminal</code> application or a <code>Run Script Phase</code> in Xcode.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet for the <code>Terminal</code> application. Note that the path to the script and the path to the WikitudeNativeSDK.framework needs to be known.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sh *PATH/TO/THE/WIKITUDE/SDK/PACKAGE*/Tools/Scripts/strip_wikitude_framework.sh -s -p *PATH/TO/THE/WikitudeNativeSDK.framework
</code></pre>
<p>To run this script in a <code>Run Script Phase</code>, simply copy the following snippet into a new <code>Run Script Phase</code> text field. Please make sure that the <code>Run Script Phase</code> is positioned right after the <code>Embed Frameworks</code> build phase (You can reorder individual build phases).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sh &quot;${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/WikitudeNativeSDK.framework/strip_wikitude_framework.sh&quot; -s -p &quot;${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/WikitudeNativeSDK.framework&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="images/ios_setup_6__run_script_text_field.png" alt=" "></p>
<h3 id="bitcode">Bitcode</h3>
<p>The WikitudeNativeSDK.framework contains <code>Bitcode</code> information to support <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html" target="_blank">App Thinning</a>. Building a .framework with bitcode enabled leads to a larger file size. In case the application that uses the WikitudeNativeSDK.framework does not support bitcode and file size is a problem, bitcode information can be removed using the <code>wikitude_bitcode.sh</code> shell script. This script can either be run from the <code>Terminal</code> application or a <code>Run Script Phase</code> in Xcode. Wikitude recommends to use the <code>Terminal</code> application to not unnecessarily increase build time.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet for the <code>Terminal</code> application. Note that the path to the script and the path to the WikitudeNativeSDK.framework needs to be known.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sh *PATH/TO/THE/WIKITUDE/SDK/PACKAGE*/Tools/Scripts/wikitude_bitcode.sh -s -p *PATH/TO/THE/WikitudeNativeSDK.framework
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a snippet for the <code>Run Script Phase</code>. Simply copy this snippet into the script phase text field:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">sh &quot;${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/WikitudeNativeSDK.framework/wikitude_bitcode.sh&quot; -s -p &quot;${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/WikitudeNativeSDK.framework&quot;

<h2 id="unity-editor-live-preview">Unity Editor Live Preview</h2>
<p>The <code>Live Preview</code> feature allows you to test all the Wikitude SDK functionality directly in the Unity Editor, without having to constantly build on a device.
To enable it, select the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> game object and in the inspector make sure that <code>Enable Live Preview</code> is turned on. When enabled, the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> script will choose one of the following modes as an input source.
<img src="images/unity_live_preview_setup.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="static-image">Static Image</h4>
<p>This mode allows you to track a static image in the Unity editor, which is mostly useful to quickly test the same image repeatedly. The <code>Static Image</code> field will appear when this mode is selected and you can use any image from your project, as long as it has <code>Read/Write Enabled</code> turned on in the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html">Texture Importer</a> settings.</p>
<p>The <code>Camera To Horizon Angle</code> defines the angle between the forward vector of the camera and the horizontal plane.
A value of 0 indicates that the camera is pointed directly forward, while a value of 90 means that the camera is pointed directly down to the ground.
This angle is used to define the orientation of the ground plane relative to the image, when using instant tracking.</p>
<h4 id="web-cam">Web Cam</h4>
<p>In this mode, the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> will try to find all the available cameras connected to your computer and use one of them as input for tracking. The <code>WebCams</code> dropdown allows you to select which camera should be used. If set to <code>Default</code>, the first camera found will be used.</p>
<p>The <code>Camera To Horizon Angle</code> works the same way as it does for the <code>Static Image</code> mode.</p>
<h4 id="remote-camera">Remote Camera</h4>
<p>This mode allows you to use the camera on your device, if it is connected to your computer and has the <code>Unity Remote</code> app installed and running. Please check the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html">Unity Documentation</a> for more information on how to get the remote app to work. This mode is very useful in case your computer doesn&#39;t have any cameras attached.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>Instant Tracking</code> will only work properly in this mode, because we can use all the sensors from the connected device, which are not available in other modes.
<img src="images/unity_live_preview_remote.png" alt="Image tracking in the Editor using the Unity Remote App"></p>

<h2 id="examples-tutorials">Examples &amp; Tutorials</h2>
<p>The Wikitude Unity example project gives you a quick overview of the capabilities offered by the Wikitude Native SDK in combination with Unity. You can find the project in the Wikitude Unity download package. Once the .zip file is extracted, the project is located in the <code>/Examples</code> folder. In the <code>Assets/Wikitude/Samples/Scenes</code> folder you will find scenes focused on specific parts of the SDK. The examples are also included in the Unity package located in the <code>/Package</code> folder.</p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>Each example focuses on a part of the SDK specified by its name. Each example follows a similar structure. They all include the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> prefab, a <code>UI</code> root GameObject and a <code>Controller</code> GameObject with a corresponding script used to provide the custom behaviour for each sample. Most samples also include an <code>ImageTracker</code>, <code>CloudTracker</code>, <code>ObjectTracker</code> or <code>InstantTracker</code> prefab, while some create them it during runtime.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>To run the application, open the Unity scene called <code>Main Menu</code> which is located in the <code>Assets/Scenes</code> folder. Once the project is loaded, it needs to be exported as either Xcode project (iOS) or Android Studio project (Android). Alternatively, you can build an Android .apk directly.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="setupguideunity.html">Setup Guide</a> page for more info on the build steps required for each platform.</p>

<h1 id="image-recognition">Image Recognition</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This example shows how to recognize images in the viewfinder and overlay it with images. Furthermore it shows how to recognize multiple different images and how to react on user clicks on the overlaid elements.</p>
<p>For a better understanding, here are some terms that will be used in the following and other section of this documentation related to  augmented reality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target</strong>: A target image and its associated extracted data that is used by the tracker to recognize an image.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Target collection</strong>: An archive storing a collection of targets that can be recognized by the tracker. A target collection can come from two different resource types</p>
<ul>
<li>Plain: A regular ZIP file containing images in plain JPG or PNG format</li>
<li>Pre-processed: Regular images that are converted into a WTC file (Wikitude Target collection) for faster processing and storing more images offline. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ImageTracker</strong>: The tracker analyzes the live camera image and detects the targets stored in its associated target collection. Multiple trackers can be created, however only one tracker can be active for recognition at any given time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="warning">
<b>Important: Learn how to create Image Targets</b>

Make sure to read the <a href="targetmanagement.html#image-targets">chapter on how to create Image Targets</a> before using Image Recognition on your own.
</div>


<p><a id="ExtendedRange"></a></p>
<h2 id="extended-recognition-range">Extended Recognition Range</h2>
<p>Introduced with SDK 7.0, the Wikitude SDK Image Recognition engine can make use of HD camera frames to detect images from further away. Further away in this context means distances 3x further away, compared to not enabling this mode (e.g. A4-sized target can reach recognition distances in the area of 2.4 meters/ 8 feet). This feature is called <strong>Image Recognition Extended Range</strong> and can be activated through a setting in the <code>ImageTracker</code> class. The setting <code>extendedRangeRecognition</code> is optional and accepts the following three constants</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ON</code> </li>
<li><code>OFF</code></li>
<li><code>AUTO</code> (default)</li>
</ul>
<p>see <a href="../Reference/Unity%20API/namespace_wikitude.html#a147485c6c206ebdb78f237400f6de9eb"><code>ImageRecognitionRangeExtension</code></a></p>
<p>Processing a HD camera frame in the pipe-line is computationally more expensive - this means that this feature is only activated, if the phone can handle this additional effort without sacrificing user experience. The <code>AUTO</code> setting will determine that based on available CPU power and camera access (e.g. Camera2 API for Android) and is the default setting in the SDK.</p>
<p><a id="SimpleImageRecognitionUnity"></a></p>
<h2 id="simple-image-recognition-in-unity">Simple Image Recognition in Unity</h2>
<p>The Wikitude Unity Plugin is based on pre-configured prefabs. There are two types of prefabs available. One is the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> prefab and the other ones are tracker prefabs.</p>
<h3 id="wikitudecamera-prefab">WikitudeCamera Prefab</h3>
<p>The <code>WikitudeCamera</code> prefab takes care about rendering the live camera stream fullscreen behind all your augmentations. Attached to this prefab is a script component which has one parameter that is not pre filled. This parameter is for the Wikitude SDK license key and has to be filled with your very own license key. You can either buy a commercial license from our webpage or <a href="triallicense.html">download a free trial license key</a> and play around with our Native SDK in combination with Unity. </p>
<h3 id="imagetracker-prefab">ImageTracker Prefab</h3>
<p>To add a tracker prefab to the scene, simply drag the <code>ImageTracker</code> prefab into the scene hierarchy.</p>
<p>An <code>ImageTracker</code> itself needs a Wikitude Target Collection (.wtc file) which contains information needed to detect those reference images. Target collections can be generated and downloaded from the <a href="https://studio.wikitude.com" target="_top">Wikitude Studio</a> - a free web based tool, that you can access with your developer account. You can also generate .wtc files right inside Unity with the <a href="unitywtceditor.html">WTC Editor</a>. Place the .wtc file into the <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder, so that the Wikitude Native SDK can load them at runtime. To specify which .wtc file should be used, select the <code>ImageTracker</code> game object in the scene. Make sure that the <code>Target Source</code> is set to <code>Target Collection Resource</code> and using the dropdown next to <code>Target Collection</code> you can choose the desired one.</p>
<p>To react on events like successfully loading of a .wtc file, you can use the Unity Events listed in in the inspector of the <code>ImageTracker</code>. These events are split into two groups. The first group contains events triggered by the <code>TargetCollectionResource</code> when the wtc file was loaded of if there was an error. The second group are events triggered by the <code>ImageTracker</code> itself if it was successfully initialized with the desired .wtc file or not. On the desired event, click the plus sign to add a new subscriber, drag the GameObject that should receive the event over the <code>None (Object)</code> field and select the function you want to be called from the <code>No Function</code> dropdown. </p>
<p>When subscribing to events that have a single basic parameter type, make sure to select your function from top list marked with <code>Dynamic</code>, rather than the static version from the bottom. This ensures that the parameters are passed correctly from the Wikitude plugin and are not overwritten by Unity.</p>
<p><img src="images/select_callback.png" alt="Setting callbacks"></p>
<p>For more information on working with Unity Events, please check the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityEvents.html" target="_top">Unity Manual</a>  and <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/intermediate/live-training-archive/events-creating-simple-messaging-system" target="_top">Events Tutorial</a>.</p>
<h3 id="define-custom-augmentations">Define custom augmentations</h3>
<p>Also part of the <code>ImageTracker</code> prefab is an <code>ImageTrackable</code> object. A trackable defines which targets from your collection you want to be tracked.
If the tracker is using a .wtc file located in the <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder, the <code>ImageTrackable</code> inspector will show a list of all the targets in the .wtc file. By toggling the <code>Active</code> button, you can select which targets will be tracked by this trackable, or you can choose <code>Select All</code> at the top to include all the targets. You can similarly choose which targets should use extended tracking.</p>
<p><img style="width: 350px" src="images/unity_trackable_interface.png"></p>
<p>By pressing the <code>Preview</code> button, the target will be displayed in the 3D view of the scene, providing a convenient way to place your augmentation relative to the target.</p>
<p><img style="width: 350px" src="images/unity_trackable_target_preview.png"></p>
<p>If the .wtc file is located somewhere else, for example if you are downloading it at runtime, or when using <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> instead, you can still select which targets will be included by entering the target name into the <code>TargetPattern</code> text field. Possible values are full target image names (e.g. <code>pageOne</code>, <code>pageTwo</code>) or wildcards (<code>page*</code>). You can use <code>*</code> if you want to include all targets.</p>
<div class="warning"> 
If the .wtc file you are using is not located in the StreamingAssets folder, kindly make sure that the <code>targetName</code> used with the <code>ImageTrackable</code> component correspond to one of the target names in your target collection. You can also use wildcards to match any target or only a specific subset of targets.
</div>

<p>In order to place 3D objects at the location where the reference image was found in the camera stream, add any GameObject as a child to the <code>ImageTrackable</code> object. During runtime, only the transform of the camera will be changed, so you can place and scale the <code>ImageTrackable</code> GameObject and its children however it is most convenient for you. Keep in mind that if you move the <code>ImageTrackable</code> GameObject during runtime, the camera will follow it, so you won&#39;t see any effective changes. If you need to move augmentations relative to the camera, for example when dragging augmentations based on user input, please make sure not to move <code>Trackable</code> GameObject, but its children.</p>
<p>The <code>Auto Toggle Visibility</code> toggle is enabled by default. When this is checked, the <code>ImageTrackable</code> GameObject will be automatically disabled when the target is out of view and enabled back when a target is tracked again.</p>
<p>To handle visibility manually, you can turn this toggle off and subscribe to the <code>OnImageRecognized</code> and <code>OnImageLost</code> events on the trackable. This can be useful when you want to show different augmentations based on which target was tracked. The string parameter of these events will indicate which target was tracked or lost.</p>
<p>The <code>OnImageRecognized</code> and <code>OnImageLost</code> events are called even when the <code>Auto Toggle Visibility</code> toggle is turned on. As an example, the <code>Image Recognition - Extended Tracking</code> updates the UI when the target is lost by handling <code>OnImageLost</code>.</p>
<p><a id="MultipleTargetsUnity"></a></p>
<h2 id="multiple-targets">Multiple Targets</h2>
<p>An image tracker can track multiple targets at the same time. This can be configured in the <code>ImageTracker</code> inspector, by setting the <code>Concurrent Targets</code> to a value larger than 1. However, keep in mind that if you don&#39;t plan to use multiple targets, it is best to leave the value at 1 for optimal performance.</p>
<p>To define augmentations for multiple targets, you will need to set a prefab to the <code>Drawable</code> field in the <code>ImageTrackable</code> inspector. At runtime, when a new target is recognized the <code>Drawable</code> prefab will be instantiated and placed in the scene as a child of the <code>Trackable</code> and when the target is lost, it will be destroyed. When multiple targets are being tracked, their corresponding <code>Drawables</code> are positioned in the game world to match what the camera sees. This also means that you can infer the relative positions between targets directly in the game world.</p>
<p>This behaviour was designed to allow easy setup for simple use cases, but if you may need more control over the lifetime of the augmentations. If that is the case, you can leave the <code>Drawable</code> field empty in the <code>ImageTrackable</code> inspector and add callbacks to the <code>OnImageRecognized</code> and <code>OnImageLost</code> events. When <code>OnImageRecognized</code> is called, the <code>ImageTarget</code> that is passed as a parameter will contain a <code>Drawable</code> GameObject property. This empty GameObject behaves the same way as the <code>Drawable</code> described above and you should use it as a parent for your augmentations, to make sure they are positioned properly.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public void OnImageRecognized(ImageTarget recognizedTarget) {
    // Create the custom augmentation.
    // You can use recognizedTarget.Name and recognizedTarget.ID 
    // if you need custom augmentations for each target and instance.
    GameObject newAugmentation = GameObject.CreatePrimitive(PrimitiveType.Sphere);

    // Set the newAugmentation to be a child of the Drawable.
    newAugmentation.transform.parent = recognizedTarget.Drawable.transform;

    // Position the augmentation relative to the Drawable by using the localPosition.
    newAugmentation.transform.localPosition = Vector3.zero;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that the <code>Drawable</code> is still destroyed when the target is lost, so if you still have the augmentations attached to it, they will be destroyed as well. The <code>OnImageLost</code> event is called before the <code>Drawable</code> is destroyed, so you can use that event to move the augmentations somewhere else if they need to persist after the target was lost.</p>
<p>In case the same target is detected multiple times simultaneously, the ID property in the <code>ImageTarget</code> parameter will help you distinguish between them.</p>
<p><a id="ExtendedImageTrackingUnity"></a></p>
<h2 id="extended-tracking">Extended Tracking</h2>
<p>Extended tracking is an optional mode you can set for each target separately. In this mode the Wikitude SDK will continue to scan the environment even if the original target image is not in view anymore. So the tracking extends beyond the limits of the original target image. The performance of this feature depends on various factors like computing power of the device, background texture and objects.</p>
<p>If the .wtc file containing the targets is located in the <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder, you should be able to see a list of all the targets in the inspector of the <code>Image Trackable</code>. To enable extended tracking, simply tick the <code>Extended tracking</code> option next to each target you want to extend, or select <code>Extend All</code> at the top of the list to extend all the targets.
If the .wtc file is loaded at runtime from a custom location, the <code>Image Trackable</code> will have a simpler interface, that will allow you to enable extended tracking manually and specify the names of the targets you would want to be extended. You can set the first name in the list to the wildcard <code>*</code> to extend all targets in the collection.</p>
<p>When Extended Tracking is enabled, the <code>ImageTracker</code> will fire <code>OnExtendedTrackingQualityChangedEvents</code>, which will let you know how well extended tracking is working based on the factors mentioned above.</p>
<p><a id="RuntimeTrackerUnity"></a></p>
<h2 id="runtime-tracker">Runtime Tracker</h2>
<p>Image trackers can be created at runtime with no restrictions on the location of the target collection used. To do this, simply create a new GameObject and add the <code>ImageTracker</code> component to it, select <code>TargetCollectionResource</code> as the <code>TargetSourceType</code> and create a new <code>TargetCollectionResource</code> object. If you are using a collection located in the <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder, the <code>TargetPath</code> property should be the path relative to the <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder and <code>UseCustomUrl</code> property should be false. </p>
<p>If you want to use a collection located elsewhere on the device or on the web, the <code>TargetPath</code> property should be set to the absolute path to the target, prefixed by the protocol <code>file://</code>, <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> as appropriate. The <code>UseCustomUrl</code> in this case should be set to true. Please see the sample <code>Client Tracker - Runtime Tracker</code> as an example of how to set this up.</p>
<p>Trackables can also be created at runtime, but make sure to add them as a child of the tracker before the <code>Start()</code> method is called on the parent tracker, otherwise it won&#39;t get registered in time.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">GameObject trackerObject = new GameObject(&quot;ImageTracker&quot;);
ImageTracker imageTracker = trackerObject.AddComponent&lt;ImageTracker&gt;();

imageTracker.TargetSourceType = TargetSourceType.TargetCollectionResource;
imageTracker.TargetCollectionResource = new TargetCollectionResource();
imageTracker.TargetCollectionResource.UseCustomURL = true;
imageTracker.TargetCollectionResource.TargetPath = &quot;https://url.to.your.collection/collection.wtc&quot;;

GameObject trackableObject = GameObject.Instantiate(TrackablePrefab);
trackableObject.transform.SetParent(imageTracker.transform, false);
</code></pre>
<p>Creating trackers at runtime is also possible when using the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> instead of a <code>TargetCollectionResource</code></p>
<p><a id="MultipleTrackersUnity"></a></p>
<h2 id="multiple-trackers">Multiple Trackers</h2>
<p>You can have multiple trackers in the same scene, but only one can be active at a time. If you enable a second one, the first one will be automatically disabled by the plugin.</p>

<h1 id="instant-tracking">Instant Tracking</h1>
<p>The following sections detail the instant tracking feature of the Wikitude Native SDK by introducing a minimal implementation, showcasing the simplicity the Wikitude Native SDK provides.</p>
<h2 id="smart-seamless-ar-tracking">SMART - Seamless AR Tracking</h2>
<p>SMART is a seamless API which integrates ARKit, ARCore and Wikitude’s SLAM in a single augmented reality SDK, cross-platform, for any device. It ensures the delivery of the best possible augmented reality experience on a wider range of devices, covering 92,6% of iOS devices and about 35% of Android devices available in the market.</p>
<p>SMART is enabled by default but can be disabled by unchecking the <code>SMART Enabled</code> checkbox located at the top of the <code>Instant Tracker</code> inspector.
Alternatively, it can be disabled in code using the <code>SMARTEnabled</code> property on the <code>InstantTracker</code>. Please keep in mind that this needs to happen before the <code>InstantTracker</code> initializes its native counterpart, which happens during the <code>OnEnable</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public InstantTracker tracker;

void Awake() {
    tracker.SMARTEnabled = false;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To check if the device supports platform assistance for tracking, <code>WikitudeSDK.IsPlatformAssistedTrackingSupported</code> can be called. Please keep in mind that this needs to be called after the <code>Start</code> method of the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> was executed, to make sure that the native components are properly initialized.
The <code>IsPlatformAssistedTrackingSupported</code> method doesn&#39;t return the result immediately, but takes an Action as a parameter, that will be called when the result is available</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">Tracker.IsPlatformAssistedTrackingSupported((SmartAvailability smartAvailability) =&gt; {
    if (smartAvailability == SmartAvailability.Supported) {
        /* Device offers platform tracking capabilities (ARKit or ARCore) */
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>SMART provides improved tracking capabilities at the expense of control. Because of that some Wikitude SDK features are not available when platform tracking capabilities are used by enabling SMART.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Instant tracking is an algorithm that, contrary to those previously introduced in the Wikitude SDK, does not aim to recognize a predefined target and start the tracking procedure thereafter, but immediately start tracking in an arbitrary environment. This enables very specific use cases to be implemented.</p>
<p>The algorithm works in two distinct states; the first of which is the initialization state. In this state the user is required to define the origin of the tracking procedure by simply pointing the device and thereby aligning an indicator. Once the alignment is found to be satisfactory by the user (which the users needs to actively confirm), a transition to the tracking state is performed. In this state, the environment is being tracked, which allows for augmentations to be placed within the scene.</p>
<p>The instant tracking algorithm requires another input value to be provided in the initialization state. Specifically, the height of the tracking device above ground is required in order to accurately adjust the scale of augmentations within the scene. To this end, the example features a range input element that allows the height to be set in meters.</p>
<p>During the initialization, another parameter can be set which influences the alignment of the instant tracking ground plane. This ground plane is represented by the initialization indicator and can be rotated in order to start instant tracking at e.g. a wall instead of the floor.</p>
<p><a id="basicinstanttracking"></a></p>
<h2 id="basic-instant-tracking">Basic Instant Tracking</h2>
<p>The <em>Instant Tracking</em> example provides a simple implementation of an application that allows users to place furniture in their environment.</p>
<h4 id="scene-setup">Scene Setup</h4>
<p>The scene consists mainly of the following parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>WikitudeCamera</code>: the standard prefab for the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> is used, with the exception that it is running in SD at 30 FPS. This is the recommended setup for <code>Instant Tracking</code>, as the algorithm is computationally intense and users might experience slowdowns on older devices.</li>
<li><code>UI</code>: the root of the <code>UI</code> we will be using in this sample. Since <code>Instant Tracking</code> works in two distinct phases, the <code>UI</code> is also split in two, allowing to completely switch the interface. When the <code>Instant Tracker</code> is in <code>Initializing</code> mode, the <code>UI</code> only displays a slider to control the height, as explained previously and a button to switch to <code>Tracking</code> mode. After the switch is done, the <code>UI</code> will display a button for each furniture model that can be added to the scene. Each button has an <code>OnBeginDrag</code> event trigger on it that notifies the controller when a new furniture model needs to be added to the scene. The event trigger also has an <code>int</code> parameter, specifying which model should be created.</li>
<li><code>Controller</code>: container for multiple custom script components:<ul>
<li><code>InstantTrackerController</code>: coordinates the activity between the <code>Instant Tracker</code>, the <code>UI</code>, the augmentations and the touch input.</li>
<li><code>Gesture Controllers</code>: react to touch input events and move or scale the augmentations accordingly.</li>
<li><code>Grid Renderer</code>: renders a grid with 25 cm spacing that can be helpful during initialization and tracking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Ground</code>: a simple transparent plane with a custom shader that enables shadows on it. The plane also has a collider on it and can be used for physics interaction.</li>
<li><code>Instant Tracker</code>: the component that actually does all the tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/unity_instant_tracker_scene.png" alt="Instant Tracker scene"></p>
<h4 id="instant-tracker-controller">Instant Tracker Controller</h4>
<p>The controller script coordinates all the other components of the scene. It contains references to all the UI elements and responds to events from them. </p>
<p>In the <code>Awake</code> function, the <code>Application.targetFrameRate</code> is set to 60. Even though the camera and tracking is running only at 30 FPS, having Unity running at a higher FPS allows for smoother user interaction.</p>
<p>When a drag is detected and the <code>OnBeginDrag</code> callback is called, we create a new model based on the index we receive and place it at the touch position, facing the camera.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">// Select the correct prefab based on the modelIndex passed by the Event Trigger.
GameObject modelPrefab = Models[modelIndex];
// Instantiate that prefab into the scene and add it in our list of visible models.
Transform model = Instantiate(modelPrefab).transform;
_activeModels.Add(model.gameObject);
// Set model position by casting a ray from the touch position and finding where it intersects with the ground plane
var cameraRay = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
Plane p = new Plane(Vector3.up, Vector3.zero);
float enter;
if (p.Raycast(cameraRay, out enter)) {
    model.position = cameraRay.GetPoint(enter);
}

// Set model orientation to face toward the camera
Quaternion modelRotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(Vector3.ProjectOnPlane(-Camera.main.transform.forward, Vector3.up), Vector3.up);
model.rotation = modelRotation;
</code></pre>
<p>When the tracker loses the scene, which can happen when moving the device too fast, we make sure that all the models and the grid are hidden. Because the camera is not moved anymore when tracking is lost, the augmentations would appear to be frozen on the screen if they were not hidden. We also need to disable the furniture buttons, to prevent users from adding new objects. </p>
<p>While the SDK doesn&#39;t currently work in Edit Mode, you can still test the demo in the Editor by using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityRemote5.html" target="_top">Unity Remote</a>. The SDK will also send most of the callbacks you expect in Edit Mode as well, allowing you to prototype gesture interaction without constantly building on a device.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_instant_tracker_sample.png" alt="Instant Tracker sample running on a device"></p>
<p><a id="instantscenepicking"></a></p>
<h2 id="instant-scene-picking">Instant Scene Picking</h2>
<p>The <em>Scene Picking</em> example shows how you can convert a touch position to a 3D position that maps to the environment. When using this API, users could for example place objects not only on the ground plane, but also on top of real world objects.</p>
<h4 id="scene-setup">Scene Setup</h4>
<p>The scene structure is similar to the one described in the <em>Instant Tracking</em> example, but has been simplified a bit. Specifically, the UI doesn&#39;t contain any furniture related controls, and there are no Gesture Controllers anymore.</p>
<h4 id="scene-picking-controller">Scene Picking Controller</h4>
<p>The controller script is also much simpler than that of the <em>Instant Tracking</em> example. Its main concerns are listening for touch inputs, converting those inputs to 3D coordinates and placing an augmentation there. It is also responsible for the managing the state of the <code>InstantTracker</code>.</p>
<p>To convert input touch positions to 3D coordinates, the script calls the <code>ConvertScreenCoordinate</code> method on the <code>InstantTracker</code>, passing it the touch position as Unity provides it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">void Update() {
    if (_isTracking &amp;&amp; Input.GetMouseButtonUp(0)) {
        Tracker.ConvertScreenCoordinate(Input.mousePosition);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the conversion can take a long time, it is done on a separate thread and a callback event is provided in the <code>InstantTracker</code> to let you know when the results are available. The example script registers to this event in the <code>Awake</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">void Awake() {
    Tracker.OnScreenConversionComputed.AddListener(OnScreenConversionComputed);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, when the conversion was computed, it adds the augmentation to the specified location. It firsts needs to check if the conversion was successful, as it can fail if there is not enough information in the point cloud where the touch event happened. It adds the augmentation as a child of the _trackable, because the coordinates are in the local space of the <code>InstantTrackable</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public void OnScreenConversionComputed(bool success, Vector2 screenCoordinate, Vector3 pointCloudCoordinate) {
    if (success) {
        var newAugmentation = GameObject.Instantiate(Augmentation, _trackable.transform) as GameObject;
        // The pointCloudCoordinate values are in the local space of the trackable.
        newAugmentation.transform.localPosition = pointCloudCoordinate;
        _augmentations.Add(newAugmentation);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><a id="persistentinstanttargets"></a></p>
<h2 id="persistent-instant-targets">Persistent Instant Targets</h2>
<p>The save and load instant targets feature allows for AR experiences to be persistently accessed by multiple users across devices and operating systems. Furthermore instant targets can be expanded on the fly. This section is concerned with showcasing this feature based on the corresponding samples of the sample application.
This feature is not available with platform assisted tracking enabled.</p>
<p>The <em>Save Instant Target</em> and <em>Load Instant Target</em> samples shows how to use this feature in Unity.</p>
<h5 id="scene-setup">Scene Setup</h5>
<p>The scenes are similar to the one described in the <em>Instant Tracking</em> example, except that the <code>Controller</code> GameObject has an additional script attached, the <code>SaveInstantTarget</code> or <code>LoadInstantTarget</code> script, respectively.</p>
<h5 id="save-instant-target">Save Instant Target</h5>
<p>To save an instant target, the <code>InstantTracker.SaveCurrentInstantTracker</code> method needs to be called while the <code>InstantTracker</code> is in tracking mode. The method accepts two <code>Action</code> parameters that will be called in case of success or failure. The directories of the provided path also needs to exist.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">private void SaveTarget() {
    var path = Application.persistentDataPath + &quot;/InstantTarget.wto&quot;;
    Tracker.SaveCurrentInstantTarget(path, SaveSuccessHandler, SaveErrorHandler);
    InfoMessage.text = &quot;Saving instant target to: &quot; + path;
}

private void SaveSuccessHandler(string path) {
    /* Handle success */
}

private void SaveErrorHandler(Error error) {
    /* Handle errors */
}
</code></pre>
<p>The handlers can also be implemented with lambda functions.</p>
<h4 id="load-instant-target">Load Instant Target</h4>
<p>To load an instant target, the <code>InstantTracker.LoadInstantTarget</code> method needs to be called with the path to a previously saved instant target. Similar to <code>SaveCurrentInstantTracker</code>, this method also accepts two <code>Action</code> parameters that will be called in case of success or failure. Additionally, an expansion policy can be set through the <code>InstantTargetRestorationConfiguration</code>. This controls whether the instant target should be further expanded or not.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">private void LoadTarget() {
    // A TargetCollectionResource is needed to manage file loading.
    var targetCollectionResource = new TargetCollectionResource();
    // UseCustomURL is used to specify that the file is not inside the &quot;StreamingAssets&quot; folder
    targetCollectionResource.UseCustomURL = true;
    // The &quot;file://&quot; is used to indicate that the file is located on disk, and not on a server.
    targetCollectionResource.TargetPath = &quot;file://&quot; + Application.persistentDataPath + &quot;/InstantTarget.wto&quot;;
    var configuration = new InstantTargetRestorationConfiguration();
    // Indicate that we allow the target to be expanded after it was loaded.
    configuration.ExpansionPolicy = InstantTargetExpansionPolicy.Allow;
    Tracker.LoadInstantTarget(targetCollectionResource, configuration, LoadSuccessHandler, LoadErrorHandler);
}
</code></pre>
<p>After the instant target is loaded the tracker will immediately try to find and track it.</p>
<p><a id="planedetection"></a></p>
<h2 id="plane-detection-experimental">Plane Detection - Experimental</h2>
<p>Once Plane detection is enabled, the Wikitude SDK will search for planar surfaces in the representation of the scene (the point cloud). Sufficient and accurate information will then produce planar surfaces, that developers can use to interact with the actual scene. Hit testing will use found planes for a better estimate of depth values in the scene. The algorithm can detect different types of planes</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Horizontal Up</code> (e.g. floor, carpet, table)</li>
<li><code>Horizontal Down</code> (e.g. ceiling)</li>
<li><code>Vertical</code> (walls,...)</li>
<li><code>Arbitrary</code> (ramps, staircases,...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Developers can choose which type of planes they are interested in and filter correspondingly.</p>
<p>To enable plane detection for an <code>InstantTracker</code>, the <code>Plane Detection</code> option needs to be enabled in the <code>Instant Tracker</code> inspector, or through the C# API.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_plane_detection_enable_inspector.png" alt="Instant Tracker Inspector"></p>
<p>Once this is enabled, augmentations can be drawn using two methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attaching a prefab to the <code>Plane Drawable</code> property in the <code>Instant Trackable</code> inspector. This will instantiate the prefab whenever a new plane is detected and attach it to the plane. When the plane is lost, the instantiation will be destroyed.</li>
<li>Subscribing to the <code>On Plane Recognized</code>, <code>On Plane Tracked</code> and <code>On Plane Lost</code> in the <code>Instant Trackable</code> inspector. This will allow you to react to plane detection events in a custom way, as well as providing additional information about the plane, such as extents and convex hull.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/unity_plane_detection_callbacks_inspector.png" alt="Instant Tracker Inspector"></p>
<p>Here is an example of how to handle the three plane callbacks. Please not that some error validation and mesh generation have been omitted from this example. Please see the full example code in the <code>PlaneRenderer.cs</code> script.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public void OnPlaneRecognized(Wikitude.Plane recognizedPlane) {
    // Create a new augmentation.
    var renderPlane = new GameObject(&quot;Plane&quot;);
    // Attach the augmentation to the plane.
    renderPlane.transform.SetParent(recognizedPlane.Drawable.transform);

    // Create a new mesh to represent the recognized plane.
    var mesh = new Mesh();
    renderPlane.AddComponent&lt;MeshFilter&gt;().mesh = mesh;
    renderPlane.AddComponent&lt;MeshRenderer&gt;().material = new Material(RenderPlaneMaterial);

    // Update the augmentation with data from the plane.
    UpdateMesh(renderPlane, mesh, recognizedPlane);

    // Keep track of currently recognized planes so that their corresponding augmentations can be updated.
    _renderPlanes.Add(recognizedPlane.ID, renderPlane);
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public void OnPlaneTracked(Wikitude.Plane trackedPlane) {
    // Find the corresponding augmentation for the plane that is being updated.
    GameObject renderPlane;
    if (_renderPlanes.TryGetValue(trackedPlane.ID, out renderPlane)) {
        // Update the augmentation with new data from the plane.
        UpdateMesh(renderPlane, renderPlane.GetComponent&lt;MeshFilter&gt;().sharedMesh, trackedPlane);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public void OnPlaneLost(Wikitude.Plane lostPlane) {
    // Find the corresponding augmentation for the plane that was lost.
    GameObject renderPlane;
    if (_renderPlanes.TryGetValue(lostPlane.ID, out renderPlane)) {
        // Destroy the associated augmentation and remove the reference to it.
        _renderPlanes.Remove(lostPlane.ID);
        Destroy(renderPlane);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When configuring <code>Plane Detection</code>, the <code>Instant Tracker</code> offers two more options:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Plane Filter</code>: This option allows you to select which type of plane should be detected, and which ones should be ignored.
The type of a recognized plane can be found through the <code>Wikitude.Plane.PlaneType</code> property.
Filtering out undesired planes types can improve performance as well, since fewer planes need to be processed.</li>
<li><code>Convex Hull</code>: This option enables the computation of the convex hull of a plane.
The convex hull can be access through the <code>Wikitude.Plane.ConvexHull</code> property as a <code>float[]</code>, where every two values represent the X and Z values of a point relative to the plane, which can be rendered as a triangle fan.
If the convex hull is not needed, it&#39;s best to disable this option, to avoid unnecessary processing.</li>
</ol>
<p>When calling <code>ConvertScreenCoordinate</code> on the <code>InstantTracker</code>, any planes that were detected will be taken into consideration automatically.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-object-and-scene-recognition">Introduction to Object and Scene Recognition</h2>
<p>Object Recognition and Tracking extend the capabilities of the Wikitude SDK to recognize and track arbitrary objects for augmented reality experiences. The feature is based on Wikitude&#39;s SLAM engine that is used throughout the SDK for any kind of tracking the environment. 
Object Recognition and Tracking let you detect objects and entire scenes, that were pre-defined by you. Suitable objects include</p>
<ul>
<li>Toys</li>
<li>Monuments and statues</li>
<li>Industrial objects</li>
<li>Tools</li>
<li>Household supplies</li>
</ul>
<p>Recognition works best for objects that have only a limited number of changing/dynamic parts. </p>
<h3 id="scene-recognition">Scene Recognition</h3>
<p>With version SDK 8 the object recognition engine can also be used to recognize larger structures that go beyond table-sized objects. The name Scene recognition reflects this in particular. The new image-based conversion method allows for Object targets that are a lot larger in size, that can be successfully recognized and tracked. </p>
<ul>
<li>Rooms</li>
<li>Face of buildings</li>
<li>Squares and courtyards</li>
</ul>
<p><div class="warning">
<b>Important: Learn how to create Object Targets</b></p>
<p>Make sure to read the <a href="targetmanagement.html#object-targets">chapter on how to create Object Targets</a> before using Object Recognition on your own.
</div>
<a id="ObjectTrackingUnity"></a></p>
<h2 id="object-tracking-in-unity">Object Tracking in Unity</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with the Object Tracking sample, please make sure you are familiar with how Image Tracking works first by reading about the <a href="imagerecognitionnative.html">Image Tracking</a> samples. Most concepts described there work in a similar way for Object Tracking.</p>
<h2 id="objecttracker-prefab">ObjectTracker Prefab</h2>
<p>To add a tracker prefab to the scene, simply drag the <code>ObjectTracker</code> prefab into the scene hierarchy.</p>
<p>An <code>ObjectTracker</code> itself needs a Wikitude Object Collection (.wto file) which contains information needed to detect the reference objects. Target collections can be generated and downloaded from <a href="https://studio.wikitude.com" target="_top">Wikitude Studio</a> - a free web based tool, that you can access with your developer account. You can use the .wto file in the same way as .wtc files are used for the <code>ImageTracker</code>.</p>
<p>Recognition events also work exactly like recognition events for the <code>ImageTracker</code>.</p>
<h2 id="define-custom-augmentations">Define custom augmentations</h2>
<p>Because an <code>ObjectTracker</code> can only recognize and track a single object at a time, you can define augmentations either by defining a <code>Drawable</code> prefab in the <code>ObjectTrackable</code>, or by placing them directly as child objects to the trackable and enabling <code>Auto Toggle Visibility</code>.</p>
<p>In the <code>Object Tracking - Object Tracking</code> scene, the <code>Drawable</code> prefab workflow is illustrated. A <code>FiretruckAugmentation</code> prefab was created in the <code>SamplePrefabs</code> folder and assigned to the <code>ObjectTrackable</code>. The transform of the prefab has been modified so that the augmentations will match the real object during tracking.</p>
<p>Within the <code>FiretruckAugmentation</code> prefab you will also find the <code>FiretruckOccluder</code> GameObject which contains two meshes that are used as occluders. You can read more about occluders and how they work in Unity <a href="occludersunity.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="extended-tracking-for-objects">Extended Tracking for Objects</h2>
<p>Extended tracking is an optional mode you can set for each target separately. In this mode the Wikitude SDK will try to continue to scan the environment of the user even if the original target object is not in view anymore. So the tracking extends beyond the limits of the original target object. The performance of this feature depends on various factors like computing power of the device, background texture and objects.</p>
<p>To enable Extended Object Tracking, select the <code>ObjectTrackable</code> and enable the <code>Extended Tracking</code> option in the inspector. In the <code>Targets For Extended Tracking</code> you can specify which targets should be extended. If you want all targets to be extended, simply set <code>1</code> in the <code>Size</code> field and <code>*</code> in the <code>Element 0</code> field.</p>

<h1 id="cloud-recognition">Cloud Recognition</h1>
<p class='intro' markdown='1'>The Wikitude Cloud Recognition service is a cloud-based service provided by Wikitude, which recognizes images sent from Android and iOS apps using the Wikitude SDK. The recognized images are then tracked in the live camera feed and can be used for augmented reality experiences.</p>

<p>This documentation focuses on the RESTful API called Manager API, which is used to interact on a backend level with the Cloud Recognition service.</p>
<h2 id="general-definitions">General Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target</strong>: An image and its associated extracted data that is used to recognize an image.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Target Collection</strong>: A group of <code>targets</code> that are searched together. Think of it as a directory, which contains all your images you want to search. The Wikitude SDK can work with two different sorts of <code>TargetCollections</code></p>
<ul>
<li>On-device Target Collection: a static <code>wtc</code> file containing the extracted data of your images. Can consist of up to 1,000 images.</li>
<li>Cloud Target Collection: A target collection stored on the Wikitude server. See <code>Cloud Archive</code> below. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cloud Archive</strong>: An archive stored on the server that is optimized for cloud-based recognition. It is generated from a <code>TargetCollection</code> and is used in combination with the Wikitude SDK <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/CloudRecognitionService.html"><code>AR.CloudRecognitionService</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ImageTracker</strong>: Instead of analysing and computing the live camera feed directly on the device like the combination of <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/ImageTracker.html"><code>AR.ImageTracker</code></a> and <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/TargetCollectionResource.html"><code>AR.TargetCollectionResource</code></a>, the combination of <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/ImageTracker.html"><code>AR.ImageTracker</code></a> and <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/CloudRecognitionService.html"><code>AR.CloudRecognitionService</code></a> will send the image(s) taken by the camera to the Wikitude Cloud Recognition server. The server will then do the hard work of trying to match the image with your targets in the specified cloud archive. Beside the benefit of searching in large image database using the <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/CloudRecognitionService.html"><code>AR.CloudRecognitionService</code></a> instead of <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/TargetCollectionResource.html"><code>AR.TargetCollectionResource</code></a> has also a positive impact on the general performance in most cases. Especially when using a large target collection and on older devices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Manager API</strong>: A RESTful web API allowing developers to interact with the Cloud Recognition server for managing <code>Targets</code>, <code>TargetCollections</code> and <code>Cloud Archives</code>. Only you as a developer uses this API. None of your users of your app will interact with this API.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Client API</strong>: The Client API is the interface between the Wikitude SDK and the Cloud Recognition Service. The API itself is encapsulated in the Wikitude SDK class <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/CloudRecognitionService.html"><code>AR.CloudRecognitionService</code></a> and not directly accessible. Calls on the client API are called <code>Scans</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Region</strong>: Wikitude is providing several hosting locations for its Cloud Recognition services to cut down unwanted network latency. As a developer you need to choose on which <code>Region</code> you and your customers want to operate. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-the-cloud-recognition-service">Getting Started with the Cloud Recognition Service</h2>
<h3 id="regional-availability-of-wikitude-cloud-recognition-service">Regional availability of Wikitude Cloud Recognition Service</h3>
<p>As a developer using Wikitude Cloud Recognition Service you need to choose which server location you want to use for your projects. Wikitude operates several servers running Wikitude Cloud Recognition Service in different locations world-wide.</p>
<p>As the region servers are separated, content which is stored on one region server is only available on this particular server. <strong>Content is not synced across regions</strong>. You can choose from the following <code>Regions</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Americas</code></li>
<li><code>Europe</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The servers for each region have separate dedicated domain names and therefore different configurations. </p>

</ol>
<p>For more information on the available endpoints and how to work with the Manager API see the <a href="cloudrecognitionworkflow.html">workflow section</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of creating a <code>TargetCollection</code>, adding one or more <code>Targets</code>, and generating a <code>Cloud Archive</code> by calling the REST API, the <a href="#targetmanagerregional">Wikitude Targetmanager</a> can be used to perform these steps (1-4) in the browser alternatively.</p>
<p>In case you would like to immediately test the API calls we recommend the tool <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. It helps you to quickly construct the requests and analyze the responses.</p>
<h2 id="authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>The Cloud Recognition Service knows three authentication items, that you need in order to work with the service</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Manager API token</strong> You need this token to authenticate yourself against the RESTful Manager API. The Manager API is used to create, add and delete targets and target collections. The token identifies your developer account. Calls to the Manager API do not count towards your quota limits.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Client API token</strong> You need this token to authenticate calls from the Wikitude SDK to the Cloud Recognition services. It again authenticates calls as legitimate. The token is bound to your developer account. Calls from the Wikitude SDK to the service with a wrong or missing token can&#39;t access your target collections. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Group ID</strong> This value helps us load-balancing your calls and provider a better service overall. The value was introduced with SDK 8.0 and is mandatory since then. It is part of the Client API and needs to be added to your tracker. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="authentication-on-the-manager-api">Authentication on the Manager API</h3>
<p>The <strong>Manager API token</strong> must be added to each call towards the Wikitude Cloud Recognition Manager API. The token authenticates the user account that is using the API. </p>
<h3 id="authentication-on-the-client-api">Authentication on the Client API</h3>
<p>The <strong>Client API token</strong> and <strong>Group ID</strong> must be added to your app project using the Wikitude SDK. These tokens are needed additionally beside the SDK license key when working with the <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/CloudRecognitionService.html"><code>AR.CloudRecognitionService</code></a> class.</p>
<h2 id="quota-and-limits">Quota and Limits</h2>
<h3 id="general-upload-limit">General Upload Limit</h3>
<p>The Wikitude Cloud Recognition <strong>will not accept images bigger than 1024kB</strong> (1 MB). Trying to upload images exceeding this file size will result in a HTTP status code <code>400</code> together with an error message <code>FILE_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEED</code>.</p>
<h3 id="limits-for-the-wikitude-cloud-recognition-service">Limits for the Wikitude Cloud Recognition Service</h3>
<p>There are two main limitations for the Wikitude Cloud Recognition service that you need to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Targets</strong> Your token has a certain number of targets that you can upload and store on the cloud service under your developer account. The limit is always counted for your entire developer account and not for a single target collection. The service is not counting single uploads, but how many targets are currently stored in target collections under your account. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scans</strong> Scans are in effect calls from the Wikitude SDK via the Client API to the Cloud Recognition servers. All commercial license come with an allowance of 1,000,000 scans per month per developer account. <strong>Note:</strong> When using Continuous Search mode multiple calls are made to the server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="maximum-number-of-targets-in-a-target-collection">Maximum Number of Targets in a Target Collection</h3>
<p>A target collection can&#39;t exceed 50,000 targets.</p>
<h3 id="free-trial-license-for-cloud-recognition">Free Trial License for Cloud Recognition</h3>
<p>Wikitude provides a trial token for each developer account to try out the Cloud Recognition for free. This trial token has set a quota limit that allows developers to try and test the functionality of the service. Limitations for trial accounts</p>
<ul>
<li>Targets: 50,000</li>
<li>Scans: 1,000 per month</li>
</ul>
<p>To get your trial token for the REST API, please visit the <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/developer/licenses">License page</a>. The trial token is directly integrated into Wikitude Studio.</p>
<h3 id="commercial-licenses">Commercial Licenses</h3>
<p>For production systems, we offer commercial licenses with various quota limits for <a href="https://www.wikitude.com/store">purchase</a>.</p>

<h2 id="your-first-target-collections">Your first Target Collections</h2>
<p>Target Collections are central to working with Cloud Recognition service. They keep all your target images and are the base for the cloud archive.</p>
<p>Think of TargetCollection as a directory, where your images are stored. A TargetCollection forms a logical group, which is searched as a whole. Of course you can have several TargetCollections in your account, each consisting up to 50,000 images each. </p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-cloud-archive-and-target-collection">What is the difference between Cloud Archive and Target Collection</h3>
<div class="warning">A Cloud Archive is an optimized version of your Target Collection for cloud-based recognition. Cloud Archives are in internal structure, that keeps all necessary data for performing image recognition on the server. </div>

<h3 id="create-a-target-collection">Create a Target Collection</h3>
<p>Creating a Target Collection is easy and can be done without any prerequisites in your account. In general it is your starting point and most likely your very first action.</p>
<p>Call the endpoint (using the domain of one of the <a href="gettingstartedcloudrecognition.html#targetmanagerregional">regional servers</a>)</p>
<pre><code>/cloudrecognition/targetCollection
</code></pre><p>with the mandatory <code>name</code> field as a <code>POST</code> request and you will create a new TargetCollection. The response will contain a TargetCollection object, where the ID is most important parameter. You can also add <code>metadata</code> to a TargetCollection in case you want to some additional descriptive information. The next step is to add images to your TargetCollection, so they can be recognized.</p>
<h2 id="add-target-images">Add Target Images</h2>
<p>A Target is an plain image that can be recognized by the Wikitude Cloud Recognition service. Adding or creating a target means to provide a URL to your image to the server, which then downloads the image, analyzes it  and adds it to the TargetCollection. To add an image call the endpoint</p>
<pre><code>/cloudrecognition/targetCollection/:tcId/target
</code></pre><p>with the <code>ID</code> of the TargetCollection, where you want to add the image. You need to add the a field <code>imageUrl</code> to your request. The image must be publicly accessible. 
Pay attention to the optional fields <code>name</code> and <code>metadata</code>. <code>name</code> is a unique identifier for your target within the TargetCollection. It is up to you to set and use this. The same is true for the <code>metadata</code> object, which takes a full JSON object and can be filled with any value you like. The <code>metadata</code> object will be present in the recognition response. </p>
<div class="tip"><strong>Important: </strong>You are not done yet. As a next step you need to Generate the Cloud Archive of your TargetCollection.</div>

<pre><code>/cloudrecognition/targetCollection/:tcId/generation
</code></pre><p>again with the <code>ID</code> of your TargetCollection and the process will be started. Since this call is asynchronous you will receive the response immediately with a path in the Location-property in the header of the response. By calling the url with the path, for example</p>
<pre><code>/cloudrecognition/targetCollection/:tcId/generation/wtc/:generationId

<h2 id="cloud-recognition-sample">Cloud Recognition Sample</h2>
<p>This example shows how to recognize images on a cloud server and then overlay it with augmentations utilizing the <code>ImageTracker</code> and <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> classes. </p>
<p>For a better understanding, here are some terms that will be used in the following and other sections of this documentation related to vision-based augmented reality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Target</strong>: An image and its associated extracted data that is used to recognize an image.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Target Collection</strong>: A group of <code>targets</code> that are searched together. Think of it as a directory, which contains all your images you want to search. The Wikitude SDK can work with two different sorts of <code>Target Collections</code></p>
<ul>
<li>On-device Target Collection: a static <code>wtc</code> file containing the extracted data of your images. Can consist of up to 1,000 images.</li>
<li>Cloud Target Collection: A target collection stored on the Wikitude server. See <code>Cloud Archive</code> below. Can consist of up to 50,000 images.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cloud Archive</strong>: An archive stored on the server that is optimized for cloud-based recognition. It is generated from a <code>Target Collection</code> and is used in combination with <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> . </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>CloudRecognitionService</strong>: Instead of analysing and computing the live camera feed directly on the device, the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> will send the image(s) taken by the camera to the Wikitude Cloud Recognition server. The server will then do the hard work of trying to match the image with your targets in the specified cloud archive. Beside the benefit of searching in large image database, using the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> has also a positive impact on the general performance in most cases.

<h3 id="cloud-recognition-in-unity">Cloud recognition in Unity</h3>
<h4 id="cloudtracker-prefab">CloudTracker Prefab</h4>
<p>To add a tracker prefab to the scene, simply drag the <code>CloudTracker</code> prefab into the scene hierarchy. The <code>CloudTracker</code> prefab also has the <code>ImageTracker</code> script, but is preconfigured to use the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> instead of a <code>TargetCollectionResource</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> needs to know which cloud archive should be loaded. This is done by entering a <code>TargetCollectionId</code> into the appropriate text field of the <code>ImageTracker</code> script component, in the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> section. To identify the SDK user, the field called <code>ClientToken</code> needs to be entered as well. With those values in place, the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> knows which image targets have to be searched for on the cloud recognition server.</p>
<p>To react on events like successfully loading a cloud archive, you can use the Unity Events listed in in the inspector of the <code>ImageTracker</code>. Please refer to the <a href="imagerecognitionnative.html">Image Recognition</a> examples for more information on how to use <code>UnityEvents</code>. When the <code>ImageTracker</code> is using the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> additional events that are specific to it are shown in the inspector.</p>
<p>To start a server recognition, call the <code>Recognize</code> or <code>StartContinuousRecognition</code> methods of the <code>Wikitude.CloudRecognitionService</code> script assigned to the <code>ImageTracker</code>. To evaluate the server response and evaluate which target was recognized and which meta information are associated with this particular image target, you can use the <code>OnRecognitionResponse</code> event on the <code>ImageTracker</code> component, in the <code>Cloud Recognition Service Events</code> section.</p>
<p>In case a continuous recognition was started, it needs to be stopped after either a image target was recognized or the application is about to quit. You can restart the continuous recognition after the target was lost to start tracking it again. Please see the <code>Cloud Recognition - Continuous Mode</code> sample for an example on how to do this.</p>
<h4 id="regional-server-endpoints">Regional server endpoints</h4>
<p>The cloud recognition server region can be selected by changing the <code>Server Region</code> option in the <code>ImageTracker</code> inspector, in the <code>Cloud Recognition Service</code> section.</p>
<h4 id="define-custom-augmentations">Define custom augmentations</h4>
<p>Augmentations are placed exactly like when using a normal <code>ImageTracker</code>, so please refer to the <a href="imagerecognitionnative.html">Image Recognition</a> examples for more information.</p>

<p>These steps will help you create an object that hides all geometry behind it, but is still transparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Project tab, create a new shader asset and name it <code>Occluder</code></li>
<li>Open the shader and paste the following code in it:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-c">Shader &quot;Unlit/Occluder&quot; {
    SubShader {
        Tags { &quot;Queue&quot; = &quot;Geometry-1&quot; }
        ColorMask 0 
        ZWrite On
        Pass { }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Create a new material and name it <code>Occluder</code> as well</li>
<li>In the material inspector<ul>
<li>Set the shader to <code>Unlit/Occluder</code></li>
<li>Make sure that the <code>Render Queue</code> is set to <code>From Shader</code>. It should have a value of 1999</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a new object that should act as an occluder.</li>
<li>In the <code>Mesh Renderer</code> component of the new occluder object, set the material to the <code>Occluder</code> material we just created.</li>
<li>The occluder object should hide all other objects behind it, but still draw the background.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want more control over which objects get hidden and which don&#39;t, you can set the <code>Render Queue</code> value of the occluder object to 2001 and the <code>Render Queue</code> value of the objects that should be occluded to 2002. This will keep all defaults objects visible and allow you to set the occlusion effect on just some objects. To set the <code>Render Queue</code> on other objects, you can either create a custom shader or add the following script to the objects:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">using UnityEngine;

public class SetRenderQueue : MonoBehaviour {

    [SerializeField]
    protected int[] m_queues = new int[] { 2002 };

    protected void Awake() {
        Material[] materials = renderer.materials;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; materials.Length &amp;&amp; i &lt; m_queues.Length; ++i) {
            materials[i].renderQueue = m_queues[i];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Tested on Unity 5.5</p>

<h2 id="camera-controls">Camera Controls</h2>
<p>The <code>WikitudeCamera</code> also provides APIs to change the settings on the device camera.</p>
<p>The first category of settings are visible and editable directly in the inspector of the <code>WikitudeCamera</code>, while the second category can only be changed through scripting. Please also see the <code>Camera Controls - Camera Settings</code> scene for an example on how to use them.</p>
<h3 id="inspector-settings">Inspector Settings</h3>
<p><img style="width: 500px" src="images/unity_camera_settings_inspector.png"></p>
<h4 id="enable-camera-rendering">Enable Camera Rendering</h4>
<p>By default, the WikitudeCamera script will render the camera frames in the background of your scene. By disabling this option, the Wikitude SDK will stop doing any kind of rendering. This also means that the WikitudeCamera script doesn&#39;t need a camera component to be attached to the same GameObject.</p>
<h4 id="static-camera">Static Camera</h4>
<p>By default, the WikitudeCamera script will move its GameObject in world space to correspond what the real camera is seeing. When the <code>Static Camera</code> option is enabled, the WikitudeCamera GameObject will never move and all the trackables will be moved relative to the camera instead. Additionally, you can move the WikitudeCamera GameObject yourself and the trackables will follow it accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="transform-override">Transform Override</h4>
<p>The <code>ActiveOverride</code> allows a custom <code>TransformOverride</code> to be applied before any Transform changes are made to the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> or any <code>Trackables</code>.</p>
<h4 id="camera-resolution">Camera Resolution</h4>
<p>The <code>Camera Resolution</code> setting indicates which resolution you would like to use. Available options are <code>SD</code>, <code>HD</code> and <code>FullHD</code>. If the desired resolution is not available, the closest available resolution will be used instead. You can also select <code>Auto</code> and the SDK will select a resolution based on the capabilities of the device.</p>
<h4 id="camera-framerate">Camera Framerate</h4>
<p>The <code>Camera Framerate</code> setting allows you to select between <code>30 FPS</code> and <code>60 FPS</code>. If <code>60 FPS</code> is selected, but the device doesn&#39;t support it, <code>30 FPS</code> will be used instead. You can also select <code>Auto</code> and the SDK will select a framerate based on the capabilities of the device.</p>
<h3 id="script-only-settings">Script Only Settings</h3>
<h4 id="camera-position">Camera position</h4>
<p>The <code>DevicePosition</code> property enables you to change between the back and front camera of the device.</p>
<h4 id="focus-mode">Focus Mode</h4>
<p>The <code>FocusMode</code> property can change the camera focus mode between <code>Locked</code>, which will keep the current focus, <code>Once</code>, which will try to focus the camera only once and <code>Continuous</code> which will constantly adapt the focus of the camera to changes in the view.</p>
<h4 id="manual-focus">Manual Focus</h4>
<p>The <code>ManualFocus</code> property allows the focal length to be set at a custom distance when the <code>FocusMode</code> is set to <code>Locked</code>. The property accepts values from 0 to 1, where 0 means focusing the camera as close as possible.</p>
<h4 id="flash-mode">Flash Mode</h4>
<p>The <code>FlashMode</code> property allows you to turn on the camera flash.</p>
<h4 id="zoom-level">Zoom Level</h4>
<p>The <code>ZoomLevel</code> property changes the zoom level used by the camera. Valid values are between 1.0 and <code>MaxZoomLevel</code>. Be sure tu query the <code>MaxZoomLevel</code> property first. A <code>MaxZoomLevel</code> value of 1.0 indicates that the device doesn&#39;t support zooming.</p>
<h4 id="auto-focus-restriction-ios-only-">Auto Focus Restriction (iOS only)</h4>
<p>The <code>AutoFocusRestriction</code> property let&#39;s you restrict the auto focus on the camera to either <code>Near</code> or <code>Far</code>. By default it is not restricted.</p>
<h4 id="ignore-trackable-scale">Ignore Trackable Scale</h4>
<p>When the <code>IgnoreTrackableScale</code> property is enabled, the camera ignores the scaling of the trackable for tracking purposes and assumes it to be 1.0f.
When doing a <code>TransformOverride</code> that also changes the scale of the trackables, this should be set to true.</p>
<h3 id="focus-at-point-of-interest">Focus at point of interest</h3>
<p>The camera focus point of interest can be changed using the <code>WikitudeCamera.FocusAtPointOfInterest</code> API. Specifying a custom focus point of interest might change the focus mode if it&#39;s not Once already.</p>
<p>The parameter given to this method call is the screen coordinate at which the underlying camera should focus at. The range is from <code>0/0</code> to <code>Screen.width/Screen.height</code>. The actual values can either be chosen manually or received through the usage of a e.g. <code>Input.mousePosition</code> method. Device orientation changes are considered in the internal SDK implementation.</p>
<h3 id="expose-at-point-of-interest">Expose at point of interest</h3>
<p>The camera exposure point of interest can be changed using <code>WikitudeCamera.ExposeAtPointOfInterest</code> API. Specifying a custom exposure point of interest might change the exposure mode if it&#39;s not Once already.</p>
<p>The parameter given to this method call is the screen coordinate at which the underlying camera should focus at. The range is from <code>0/0</code> to <code>Screen.width/Screen.height</code>. The actual values can either be chosen manually or received through the usage of a e.g. <code>Input.mousePosition</code> method. Device orientation changes are considered in the internal SDK implementation.</p>
<h3 id="external-camera-support">External camera support</h3>
<p>On supported platform (UWP), Wikitude SDK can use external cameras. External camera support can be checked with <code>WikitudeCamera.IsCameraListSupported</code>.
In the sample, we replace the Camera Position selector with a list of available camera.
The camera list is queried with <code>WikitudeCamera.GetCameraList</code> with a callback parameter that will return the number of available cameras.
The camera name can be requested with a call to <code>WikitudeCamera.GetCameraName</code> with the camera Index as a parameter.
The current active camera can be queried with <code>WikitudeCamera.GetActiveCameraIndex</code>.
Finally, you can set the active camera to use by calling <code>WikitudeCamera.SetActiveCamera</code>.</p>
<div class="warning">
Hot-plugging camera at runtime is not supported by the Wikitude SDK. For proper use of external cameras, ensure the camera is connected before starting the SDK, and that it stays connected during the lifetime of the application.
</div>

<h1 id="plugins-api">Plugins API</h1>
<p>The Plugins API provides access to the camera frame as a native pointer. This allows you to do additional processing on it, either in C#, or in native code (C++, Objective C, Java).</p>
<h2 id="unity-interface">Unity interface</h2>
<p>To enable plugins, you need to add the <code>Plugin</code> script to a GameObject. Then, you simply subscribe to the <code>On Camera Frame Available</code> event and you will be notified when a new camera frame is ready for additional processing. Please be aware that this event could be called from another thread.</p>
<p>You will receive as a parameter to the callback a <code>Wikitude.CameraFrame</code> class which contains all the information about the frame.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public class CameraFrame
{
    public long ID;
    public long ColorTimestamp;
    public ColorCameraFrameMetadata ColorMetadata;
    public List&lt;CameraFramePlane&gt; ColorData;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ColorMetadata</code> contains additional information about the camera frame, such as size and format.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">    public struct ColorCameraFrameMetadata {
        public float HorizontalFieldOfView;
        public int Width;
        public int Height;
        public CaptureDevicePosition CameraPosition;
        public FrameColorSpace ColorSpace;
        public int TimestampScale;

    }
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ColorData</code> list contains the raw <code>IntPtr</code> to the actual native memory that is used to store the frame data for each of the planes contained in the camera frame.</p>
<p>The native pointer is only valid during the duration of the current <code>On Camera Frame Available</code> call and you should never delete or change the data it&#39;s pointing to. You can pass this pointer to your own native plugins, or transfer the data in C# using <code>Marshal.Copy</code> functions.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">using UnityEngine;
using System;
using Wikitude;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class PluginController : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void OnCameraFrameAvailable(Frame frame) {

        // Example of how to transfer data from native memory
        // to a C# array

        byte[] data = new byte[frame.DataSize];
        Marshal.Copy(frame.Data, data, 0, frame.DataSize);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="sample-explanation">Sample explanation</h2>
<p>The <code>Plugins - Barcode</code> sample shows  how to integrate the popular barcode library ZXing.Net into Unity and use the Plugins API to send camera frames to it for processing.</p>
<p>The <code>PluginController.cs</code> script controls the sample. It is registered in the editor to receive <code>OnCameraFrameAvailable</code>. First, it creates a new thread that will be used to do the scanning on. This is required because scanning might take too long on some older devices, which would make the app seem unresponsive.</p>
<p>In the <code>Update</code> method, we only check if we have any new scanning results, and display them if that is the case.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">void Update() {
    if (_scanningInProgress) {
        return;
    }

    if (_scanningResult != null) {
        ResultText.text = _scanningResult;
        _scanningResult = null;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When the <code>OnCameraFrameAvailable</code> event is triggered, we first check if scanning is already in progress. If not, we convert the raw data into a <code>Color32</code> array, and then we trigger a new scan.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public void OnCameraFrameAvailable(CameraFrame frame) {
    if (_scanningInProgress) {
        return;
    }

    var metadata = frame.ColorMetadata;
    var data = new Color32[metadata.Width * metadata.Height];
    if (metadata.ColorSpace == FrameColorSpace.RGBA) {
        var rawBytes = new byte[frame.ColorData[0].DataSize];
        Marshal.Copy(frame.ColorData[0].Data, rawBytes, 0, (int)frame.ColorData[0].DataSize);

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; metadata.Width * metadata.Height; ++i) {
            data[i] = new Color32(rawBytes[i * 4], rawBytes[i * 4 + 1], rawBytes[i * 4 + 2], rawBytes[i * 4 + 3]);
        }
    } else if (metadata.ColorSpace == FrameColorSpace.RGB) {
        /* conversion code */
    } else if (metadata.ColorSpace == FrameColorSpace.YUV_420_NV12 ||
               metadata.ColorSpace == FrameColorSpace.YUV_420_NV21 ||
               metadata.ColorSpace == FrameColorSpace.YUV_420_YV12) {
        /* conversion code */
    }

    // Trigger a new scan
    Monitor.Pulse(_monitor);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, when triggering a new scan, we call the <code>Decode</code> method and get the scan result back. We enable the <code>AutoRotate</code> option so that scanning works both in Landscape, as well as in Portraits modes.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">private string Decode(Color32[] colors, int width, int height) {
    var reader = new BarcodeReader();
    reader.AutoRotate = true;
    var result = reader.Decode(colors, width, height);
    if (result != null) {
        return result.Text;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the code snippets above have been simplified for clarity. Please see the full source code for more information on thread synchronization and error handling, as well as other integration details.</p>

<h2 id="input-plugins-api">Input Plugins API</h2>
<p>The input plugins API provides a means to alter the inputs and outputs of the Wikitude Native SDK. For the input case specifically, custom frame data of arbitrary sources can be supplied as an input to the Wikitude SDK Native API for processing. Complementary, for the output case, the default rendering of the Wikitude SDK Native API can be substituted with more advanced implementations. Both cases are illustrated in two separate samples.</p>
<h3 id="unity-interface">Unity interface</h3>
<p>Input plugins are enabled by setting the <code>Has Input Module</code> toggle in the <code>Plugin</code> script to true. Once you do that, a number of additional options will appear, allowing you to configure how the input plugin behaves.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Requests Camera Frame Rendering</code> toggle controls if the SDK will display the image on the screen. If you want to do your own camera rendering, this should be turned off.</li>
<li><code>Invert Frame</code> will flip the frame vertically. The SDK expects the that the first row of pixels to correspond to the top of the image, because this is how the native cameras provide the data. However, when accessing the texture data from a Unity texture (including <code>WebCamTexture</code>) with <code>GetPixels32()</code>, the first row of the data will correspond to the bottom of the image. You can set this toggle to automatically flip image to convert from Unity format to the one expected by the SDK. This option is available only when the <code>ColorSpace</code> is <code>RGBA</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="simple-input-plugin-sample">Simple Input Plugin sample</h4>
<p>The first sample shows how to grab the camera feed with Unity and send it to the Wikitude SDK for processing and rendering. The logic of the sample is contained in the <code>SimpleInputPluginController</code> script.</p>
<p>When the <code>OnInputPluginRegistered</code> event is called, we initialize the buffer required to store the frame data. In the Update function, once we get a valid frame, we get the pixels from it using the <code>GetPixels32(Color32[])</code> method provided by the <code>WebCamTexture</code> class. To avoid additional copies of the data, we can obtain the native pointer to the data directly and send this to the SDK. The SDK will only read from this pointer during the duration of the call, so you don&#39;t need to keep the pointer around.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">private void SendNewCameraFrame() {
    GCHandle handle = default(GCHandle);
    try {
        handle = GCHandle.Alloc(_pixels, GCHandleType.Pinned);
        IntPtr frameData = handle.AddrOfPinnedObject();

        var metadata = new ColorCameraFrameMetadata();
        metadata.HorizontalFieldOfView = 58.0f;
        metadata.Width = _feed.width;
        metadata.Height = _feed.height;
        metadata.CameraPosition = CaptureDevicePosition.Back;
        metadata.ColorSpace = FrameColorSpace.RGBA;
        metadata.TimestampScale = 1;

        var plane = new CameraFramePlane();
        plane.Data = frameData;
        plane.DataSize = (uint)_frameDataSize;
        plane.PixelStride = 4;
        plane.RowStride = _feed.width;
        var planes = new List&lt;CameraFramePlane&gt;();
        planes.Add(plane);

        var cameraFrame = new CameraFrame(++_frameIndex, 0, metadata, planes);
        InputPlugin.NotifyNewCameraFrame(cameraFrame);
    } finally {
        if (handle != default(GCHandle)) {
            handle.Free();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="custom-rendering-samples">Custom Rendering samples</h4>
<p>The second sample works very similarly to the first one, except that the frame is also sent to the another script called <code>CustomCameraRenderer.cs</code>, which handles rendering of the camera frame with a custom edge detection shader. This script is placed on the camera and uses a <code>CommandBuffer</code> to instruct Unity to blit the camera texture to the screen using a custom material.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">_drawFrameBuffer = new CommandBuffer();
_drawFrameBuffer.Blit(_currentFrame, BuiltinRenderTextureType.CameraTarget, EffectMaterial);
camera.AddCommandBuffer(eventForBlit, _drawFrameBuffer);
</code></pre>
<p>The script also handles how to draw the camera frame when the aspect ratio of the feed doesn&#39;t match the aspect ratio of the screen.</p>

<h1 id="target-management">Target Management</h1>
<h2 id="image-targets">Image Targets</h2>
<p>This guide gives you an overview of how to create a target collection that you can use to detect and track images within your augmented reality experience.</p>
<p>In general, the conversion can be done via four different tools:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Wikitude Studio</strong>: A browser based tool to convert your images to a WTC file. You can find the tool under:  <a href="https://studio.wikitude.com" target="_blank">https://studio.wikitude.com</a>. You need your free developer account to log-in. This tool is described in more detail further below.</li>
<li><strong>WTC Editor within Unity Editor</strong>: The Wikitude Unity plugin installs a WTC Editor as an extension of the Unity Editor. Unity developers can manage all their targets and target collections directly within Unity Editor. Please consult the Unity documentation for more details.</li>
<li><strong>Wikitude Studio API</strong>: The Studio API provides a RESTful API to upload target images and convert them to WTC files. Read more details in the <a href="studio-api.html">section about Studio API</a></li>
<li><strong>Targets Enterprise Script</strong>: A binary shell script available for Mac OS X and Linux converting images to target collections. Pleases <a href="mailto:sales@wikitude.com">contact Wikitude Sales</a> team for technical requirements and pricing.</li>

<p><strong>Hints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>You may unpublish a project at any time but be aware that this action has an immediate effect on your application(s) making use of the credentials.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Metadata</strong> in the &#39;Edit Target&#39; dialog is solely relevant for Cloud Recognition whereat <strong>Physical Height</strong> is  relevant for the distanceToTarget feature and is required for Hololens projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Leave <strong>Physical Height</strong> empty if you do not use the distanceToTarget feature of <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/ImageTrackable.html"><code>AR.ImageTrackable</code></a>. Note it is mandatory for Hololens projects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>Metadata</strong> field is very useful. It allows you to attach JSON data to a target. That way you can define any kind of additional data and react to it dynamically in the SDK to e.g. let a button refer to a details page which is defined in the Metadata JSON.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img style="width: 500px" src="images/tmt_CloudTargetEdit.png"></p>
<h3 id="physical-height-for-image-targets">Physical Height for Image Targets</h3>
<p>For several features of the Wikitude SDK it is necessary to know the actual physical size of the Image target that is recognized. This information is used in</p>
<ul>
<li>Distance to target calculation</li>
<li>Calibrated wearable devices like Epson BT series or Hololens</li>
</ul>
<p>The Wikitude SDK only requires the actual height of the target image as information. The width of the actual image will be determined automatically. </p>
<p>There are three ways to provide that information to the Wikitude SDK</p>
<ol>
<li>Using Wikitude Studio</li>
<li>Using the JavaScript API</li>
<li>Using Unity WTC Editor</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="setting-physical-target-height-using-wikitude-studio">Setting physical target height using Wikitude Studio</h4>
<p>Wikitude Studio is the universal way to add target height information. The tool allows adding the value of each image. The height information (<code>physical target height</code>) is then stored as part of the Image Target Collection (.wtc) and will be then automatically applied in the SDK. </p>
<ol>
<li>Add a target image</li>
<li>Click <code>Properties</code></li>
<li>Add the value in the properties dialog</li>
<li>Click Save</li>
<li>Export as .wtc file</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="images/targetmanager_target_height.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="setting-physical-target-height-using-javascript-api">Setting physical target height using JavaScript API</h4>
<p>The JavaScript API allows you to set the value for target images dynamically using the <a href="../Reference/JavaScript%20API/classes/ImageTracker.html#property_physicalTargetImageHeights"><code>physicalTargetImageHeights</code></a> option of the <code>ImageTracker</code>.</p>
<h4 id="setting-physical-target-height-using-unity-wtc-editor">Setting physical target height using Unity WTC Editor</h4>
<p>The WTC Editor included in the Unity Plugin of the Wikitude SDK also includes an option to set the physical target height (Target Height), which then stores the value into the .wtc file. </p>
<p><img src="images/unity_wtc_editor_window.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="object-targets">Object Targets</h2>
<p>The object recognition feature in the Wikitude SDK works in a similar way than image recognition. It tries to find and match a pre-created reference in the live camera image. This pre-created reference is called <strong>Object Target</strong>. Sometimes we refer to it as a <em>map</em> as it is a pre-recorded SLAM map. Starting with version 8.0 of the Wikitude SDK, Object Targets can be created using videos or images (preferred) as source material. The source material is converted into a <strong>Wikitude Object Target Collection</strong>, which is stored as <code>.wto</code> file.</p>
<p>The standard process looks like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect source material: Create a video of the object or take images of the object </li>
<li>Convert the source material into a Wikitude Object Target Collection (<code>.wto</code>)</li>
<li>Use the <code>.wto</code> file in your app project.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following chapters, we describe video-based and image-based methods in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="image-based-conversion-recommended-">Image-based conversion (recommended)</h3>
<p>Starting with version 8.0 of the Wikitude SDK, Object Targets can be generated from a set of images, instead of a single video. This approach has several advantages over the video-based conversion. For that, we recommend image-based conversion as the preferred method. It will always produce better results compared to the video-based conversion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The approach itself generates more accurate Object Targets</li>
<li>The resolution of the input can be a lot higher compared to videos, which leads to more accurate results</li>
<li>Images are easier to create from difficult angles</li>
<li>You can add images from different backgrounds of the same object to increase recognition accuracy</li>
<li>Object Targets can be extended with additional images to cover additional areas of the object</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="take-images-of-your-object">Take images of your object</h4>
<p>The first step is to collect images from your object. This step is essential, as the source material will determine the quality of your Object Target. In general, it does not matter where the images originate from - either manually taken or generated and rendered in a 3D/CAD software.</p>
<p><a href="objecttargetguide.html">Please refer to this guide</a> for a detailed list of recommendations which images to use.</p>
<h4 id="convert-images-into-object-target-collection">Convert images into Object Target Collection</h4>
<p>There are two ways to convert your images into an Object Target Collection</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Studio web front-end</li>
<li>Use RESTful APIs of the Studio APIs</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="using-wikitude-studio">Using Wikitude Studio</h5>
<p>You might have used Studio  already when working with Image Targets. Wikitude Studio is a free web-tool that helps you manage your Targets that are used in combination with the Wikitude SDK. </p>
<ol>
<li>Log-in to <a href="https://studio.wikitude.com">Wikitude Studio</a> with your Wikitude developer account</li>
<li>Create Project for Object Targets by selecting <code>Object</code> as the type for the new project</li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate SDK version number in the field <code>SDK version</code>. To use image-based conversion you have to set this to <code>8.0</code> or higher</p>
<p><img src="images/targetmgr_ibc_1.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter the project</p>

<li><p>Upload the set of images you want to use.</p>
<p><img src="images/targetmgr_ibc_2.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li><p>Select recording device or FOV - For creating the Object Target file the service needs to know, which device the images were taken on. The relevant piece of information is the <em>Field of View</em> or <em>FoV</em> of the camera, which tells how much a camera can see. Wikitude provides a list of common devices, where this value is already known. Either select the device or manually enter this value under the option <code>Custom</code></p>
<ul>
<li>When you enter the FoV manually, make sure you enter the <strong>horizontal FoV</strong>. Vendors tend to show-off their devices with a combined <em>diagonal FoV</em>, which is the largest value. Do not use <em>diagonal FoV</em> but only <strong>horizontal FoV</strong>.</li>
<li><p><strong>Automatic detection of FoV value</strong>: For image-based conversion the service will try to identify automatically the <em>FoV</em> value of every image that you upload. It is doing so by reading out EXIF data that are stored together with your JPEG images. In case either one of the the following EXIF properties is set correctly, the conversion will use this value, no matter which value you provided in the web interface.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>35mm equivalent</code></li>
<li><code>focal plane resolution in x</code>, <code>focal plane resolution in y</code> and <code>focal plane resolution unit</code></li>

<h2 id="best-practice-for-image-targets">Best practice for Image Targets</h2>
<p>This guide gives you an overview of how to create a target collection that you can use to detect and track images within your ARchitect World.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Preferred images have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>between 500 to 1000 pixels in each dimension</li>
<li>Rich contrast</li>
<li>Evenly distributed textured areas</li>
<li>Many corner like structures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unsuitable images have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smaller dimensions than 500 pixels</li>
<li>Larger than 1000 pixels as they do not provide more accurate results</li>
<li>Large amounts of text</li>
<li>Many repetitive patterns</li>
<li>Large single-colored areas </li>
<li>Color contrast only e.g. green to red edge), because all images are processed as grayscale images</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="optimal-image-dimensions">Optimal Image Dimensions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Optimal images are sized between 500 and 1000 pixels in each dimension</li>
<li>Small images do not contain enough graphical information to extract so called feature points. The uniqueness, amount and distribution of features points are the key indicators for good detection and tracking quality</li>
<li>Larger images do not improve the tracking quality

</ul>
<h3 id="low-contrast-images">Low contrast images</h3>
<ul>
<li>Images with high local contrast and large amount of rich textured areas is best suited for reliable detection and tracking</li>
<li>Color contrast only (i.e. green to red edge) appears as high contrast to the human eye but is not discriminative to computer vision algorithms as they are operating on grayscale images
<strong><em>Tip</em></strong>: For low contrast images, try to increase the contrast of your target image with an image editing tool like Gimp or PhotoShop to improve detection and tracking quality</li>
</ul>

<img src="images/low_contrast_good.png" alt="Target image with good contrast"></p>
<h3 id="distribution-of-textured-areas">Distribution of textured areas</h3>
<ul>
<li>Images with evenly distributed textured areas are good candidates for reliable detection and tracking</li>
<li>This might be the hardest part to be in control of and often can’t be changed.
<strong><em>Tip</em></strong>: Try to crop the most prominent part of your image and use only this as target image.</li>

<h2 id="best-practice-for-object-targets">Best practice for Object Targets</h2>
<h3 id="characteristics-of-easily-trackable-objects">Characteristics of easily trackable objects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Structure and size of the object are very important. Very small objects (&lt; 5cm/2-inch) are challenging as well.</li>
<li>Object should be more or less static. Dynamic and deformable parts are ok, as long as the majority of the object stays static. Try to record only the static parts of your object.</li>
<li>Shiny and glossy surfaces on the objects are challenging. Again it depends on the number of glossy surfaces in the object.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="general-pieces-of-advice">General pieces of advice</h3>
<h4 id="general-information">General information</h4>
<p>This article should help you with the creation of a video which is needed for Wikitude’s Object Recognition feature. We want to explain how to make sure the object is lightened properly, how to avoid disturbing scenery around the object and how to make sure you can capture the object from all sides.</p>
<h4 id="lighting">Lighting</h4>
<p>One of the major factors to get a good working Object Target for object recognition is proper lighting. To achieve this softboxes work really well. They are also rather cheap and easily available. We recommend softboxes with a tripod and 3 boxes to place them around the object for homogeneous light conditions.</p>
<p><img src="images/objreco_softboxes.jpg" alt="Softboxes give proper light"></p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>To avoid tracking items in the background, it is helpful to mount a photo studio background behind and beneath the object. It is important to have a soft curve from the wall to the table or floor, to avoid edges in the background.</p>
<p><img src="images/objreco_background.jpg" alt="White noise-free background"></p>
<h3 id="image-based-conversion-best-practice">Image-based conversion - Best practice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ideally use images captured from the same camera device</li>
<li>Don’t crop images before uploading, but use original resolution</li>
<li>Ideally take pictures from the same area of the object from different spots</li>
<li>In general, results will be better when using higher-resolution images. In our tests, 12MP images work quite well. However, there is a limit to that as well. Our recommendation is to use images in the area of 12MP (4032 × 3024), which is - as of 2018 - a common resolution for smartphone cameras. </li>
<li>Take images in HDR mode if available as exposure will be evenly distributed</li>
<li>Use pictures with some overlap between each other</li>
<li>Take pictures in even lighting conditions</li>
<li>Make sure the background of the object is rather simple - any background noise that is seen on multiple images will be part of the object target.</li>
<li>Keep the object still and move around it to take pictures if feasible instead of turning the object. This is different when you use video-based conversion. For image-based conversion, we highly advise <strong>against</strong> using a turn-table.</li>
<li>Avoid taking pictures from a very close distance (few centimeters)</li>
<li>Avoid taking pictures that only show one side flat of your object. e.g. when shooting a photo of a regular box, make sure to have several faces of the box on the photo</li>
<li>Image based conversion allows you to upload images of the same object in different scenarios (e.g. white background, wooden background). Adding those will make recognition more robust against varying backgrounds. </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="video-based-conversion-best-practice">Video-based conversion - Best practice</h3>
<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>
<p>Make sure you find a room with enough space to move around freely and a table, where you can place your object on.</p>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>To avoid tracking items in the background, it is helpful to mount a photo studio background behind and beneath the object. It is important to have a soft curve from the wall to the table or floor, to avoid edges in the background.</p>
<p><img src="images/objreco_background.jpg" alt="White noise-free background"></p>
<h4 id="rotating-turntable">Rotating turntable</h4>
<p>To be able to recognize the object from all sides it is necessary to capture it from all sides. This is much easier if you place the object on a rotating turntable, a rotating cake stand or something similar and which works for the size of your object. Make sure that the surface is non-reflecting and in the same color as the background.</p>
<p><img src="images/objreco_turntable.jpg" alt="DIY rotating platform"></p>
<h4 id="filming">Filming</h4>
<p>For the filming make sure you find a good camera. A newer smartphone should work well and if you can change the exposure value, even better. Sometimes it is necessary to reduce the exposure value to stop flickering because of fluorescent light bulbs. You will recognize this immediately watching your video.</p>
<h4 id="re-encode-for-smaller-file-size">Re-encode for smaller file size</h4>
<p>We recommend re-encoding the video before uploading to video. Make sure you keep aspect-ratio of the video while doing so. There are several tools that re-encode videos reliably and fast. We have been using <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake for Mac</a>, which shows pretty good results. Again make sure you don&#39;t change the aspect ratio of the video while re-encoding.</p>
<p><strong>Some important general advice for video-based conversion:</strong>
Please read carefully!</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a sideways movement in the beginning, that is parallel to the object.</li>
<li>Objects should be placed in the center (as big as possible to reduce background noise)</li>
<li>Move slowly when capturing the object</li>
<li>If you don&#39;t want to recognize the object from a particular side you also don&#39;t have to capture it.</li>
<li>Film from different distances if you want to recognize the object from different distances.</li>
<li>Recording should be done in landscape</li>
<li>The video should be a few seconds long (10 seconds or longer)</li>
<li>Shadows in the video are treated like they belong to the object.</li>
<li>While moving closer will get you more details, try not to capture the object at close range.</li>
<li>Just capture the sides that you actually want the object to be recognizable from. </li>
<li>Do not crop the video frame and by that change the aspect ratio of the video.</li>
<li>Re-encoding into a different codec is fine. Also scaling the video, while keeping the same aspect ratio is fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you place the object stable on the rotating turntable, choose a side of the object with some structure and start capturing the video. Move close to the object to get some details, move back, get the upper part of the object and cover the whole surface of the current side. Now start rotating the object and capture the object from all sides. While rotating try to get some interesting details with good structure, this will increase the stability of the recognition and tracking. When you captured the object from all sides stop recording and check if there is no flickering and the video is looking good.</p>

<p><img src="images/objreco_filming.jpg" alt="Overall setup with object"></p>
<p><img src="images/objreco_full_setup.jpg" alt="Overall setup"></p>
<h4 id="using-3d-or-cad-software">Using 3D or CAD software</h4>
<p>Of course, you don&#39;t have to shoot the video of your object on your own but can use a rendered video from any 3D modeling or CAD software. If you do so, choose a similar rendering path as described above. </p>
<ul>
<li>First few seconds parallel movements (translation)</li>
<li>Rotation around the object</li>
<li>Capturing top-side</li>
<li>Zoom out and in again</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you export your rendering in one of the supported formats (<code>mp4</code> or <code>mov</code>).</p>

<h1 id="migration-notes">Migration Notes</h1>
<p>Migration notes for the Wikitude Unity Plugin</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-8-3-0-to-8-4-0">Migrate from 8.3.0 to 8.4.0</h2>
<p>The minimum Unity version was increased to 2017.4 LTS.
Android binaries contain libraries for the ARM64 architecture by default. Please make sure that your version of Unity has support for ARM64 and make sure it&#39;s enabled in PlayerSettings.
Android binaries no longer contain libraries for the x86 architecture. Please make sure to disable it in PlayerSettings.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-8-2-0-to-8-3-0">Migrate from 8.2.0 to 8.3.0</h2>
<p>The Unity plugin will start enforcing license checks when running in the Unity editor. Please make sure that the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> component has a proper license, the bundle identifier / package name is properly set in <code>Player Settings</code> and that the current platform is either iOS, Android or UWP. If that is not the case, tracker creation will fail and all existing samples will display an error message.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-8-0-0-to-8-1-0">Migrate from 8.0.0 to 8.1.0</h2>
<p>The <code>InstantTracker</code> now has the <code>PlaneDetectionEnabled</code>, <code>PlaneFilter</code> and <code>ConvexHullEnabled</code> properties that are used to configure <code>Plane Detection</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>InstantTrackable</code> now has a new <code>PlaneDrawable</code> property for rendering augmentations on planes and three new events related to <code>Plane Detection</code>: <code>OnPlaneRecognized</code>, <code>OnPlaneTracked</code> and <code>OnPlaneLost</code>.</p>
<p>All tracker types now have the <code>TrackerEfficiencyMode</code> property.</p>
<p>The <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> now has a new <code>GroupId</code> property that should correspond with your Wikitude cloud recognition account.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-7-2-0-to-8-0-0">Migrate from 7.2.0 to 8.0.0</h2>
<p>The minimum Unity version was increased to 5.5.6.</p>
<p>On both iOS and Android, the framework and libraries have been renamed. Please make sure to remove the old ones before updating to the new version.
If building was done automatically, please make sure the rename is taken into account.</p>
<p>The deprecated <code>Trackable Behaviour</code> class was removed.</p>
<p>The <code>Legacy Scale</code> option on the <code>ImageTracker</code> and <code>InstantTracker</code> introduced in 7.2.0 was removed.</p>
<p>The <code>PluginManager</code> was removed and replaced with the <code>Plugin</code> class. The <code>Input Plugin</code> settings were moved from <code>WikitudeCamera</code> to <code>Plugin</code>. Please see the Plugin and Custom Camera samples and documentation for more information on how the new Plugin APIs work.</p>
<p>The <code>Frame</code> class was removed. Please use the new <code>CameraFrame</code> class instead.</p>
<p>All error callbacks had their signature changed to have a single <code>Wikitude.Error</code> parameter instead of two parameters. The error code and error message were moved into the <code>Wikitude.Error</code> object.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-7-1-0-to-7-2-0">Migrate from 7.1.0 to 7.2.0</h2>
<p>The minimum Unity version was increased to 5.4.2.</p>
<p>Initialization of <code>WikitudeCamera</code> and the internal SDK was moved from <code>Awake</code> to <code>Start</code>. This means WikitudeCamera properties can now be easily changed from script, as long they are done before the <code>Start</code> method is called on the <code>WikitudeCamera</code>.</p>
<p><code>ImageTracker</code> and <code>InstantTracker</code> now have a new option called <code>Legacy Scale</code>. In previous versions of the plugin, the augmentations needed to be scaled by a factor of 10 to match their targets. In the new version, this is no longer required. However, for backwards compatibility, the <code>Legacy Scale</code> allows developers to re-enable the old behavior. Keep in mind that this option will be removed in future versions and is only intended to ease the transition of existing projects.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-7-0-0-to-7-1-0">Migrate from 7.0.0 to 7.1.0</h2>
<p>No changes.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-2-1-0-to-7-0-0">Migrate from 2.1.0 to 7.0.0</h2>
<p>Version 7.0.0 increases the minimum required version for Unity to 5.4.0. Please make sure to also upgrade Unity if you are using an older version, otherwise the plugin will not work properly.
Version 7.0.0 also increases the minimum iOS version to 9.0 and the minimum Android version to Android 4.4(19). Please update <code>minSdkVersion</code> to 19 in the manifest of your App or build.gradle if you export to a gradle project.</p>
<p>To align the Unity API with that of the Wikitude Native SDK, the general <code>TrackableBehaviour</code> component has been deprecated, and was replaced with <code>ImageTrackable</code>, <code>ObjectTrackable</code> and <code>InstantTrackable</code>. These new trackables also have different events. So instead of the generic <code>OnEnterFieldOfVision</code> from the previous version, the <code>ImageTrackable</code> has an equivalent <code>OnImageRecognized</code> event, with an <code>ImageTarget</code> parameter, instead of just a string. Similar events are present in the other trackers.
When you update to the new API, please make sure to never mix the new <code>Trackables</code> with the deprecated <code>TrackableBehaviour</code>, as this is not supported.</p>
<p>The new <code>Trackable</code> components now have an additional <code>Drawable</code> field. This was added to support multiple targets for <code>ImageTrackers</code>, but the API is available for all <code>Trackables</code>. Please see the <a href="ImageRecognitionNative.html">Image Tracking</a> examples for more information about multiple targets.</p>
<p>Additionally, some sample scripts were renamed. If you are upgrading and importing the samples as well, please check fo duplicate scripts, or for scripts that should not be present in the project anymore.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-2-0-0-to-2-1-0">Migrate from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0</h2>
<p>Version 2.1.0 adds a new value to the FrameColorSpace enum used for Plugins and Input Plugins. Because of this, when loading a scene that contains a WikitudeCamera component configured to use Input Plugins, the deserialized value of the enum will be incorrect. Please set it to the appropriate value for your use case after upgrading to 2.1.0.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-1-4-0-to-2-0-0">Migrate from 1.4.0 to 2.0.0</h2>
<p>Version 2.0.0 deprecates the <code>ClientTracker</code> and the <code>CloudTracker</code> classes. When before you used the <code>ClientTracker</code> to recognize images, it is recommended to switch to the new <code>ImageTracker</code>, in combination with a <code>TargetCollectionResource</code>. Instead of the <code>CloudTracker</code>, the same <code>ImageTracker</code> can be used, but with a <code>CloudRecognitionService</code>, instead. You can select between the <code>TargetCollectionResource</code> and the <code>CloudRecognitionService</code> in the <code>ImageTracker</code> inspector, in the first dropdown menu. Finally, if you used the <code>ClientTracker</code> to track 3D targets, you can now use the new <code>ObjectTracker</code> with a <code>TargetCollectionResource</code> for this.</p>
<p>To help migrate your project to the new APIs, the inspectors of the old classes have a button that allows you to automatically upgrade the script component with the appropriate replacement.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_upgrade_deprecated_tracker.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When you press the button, a warning message will appear, informing you that during the upgrade process, the properties set on the old tracker will be migrated to the new one, but events will <strong>not</strong>. This would not be possible, because in most cases you need to update the script functions receiving the events to the appropriate signature.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_upgrade_warning.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After pressing OK, GameObject will have the new component instead. If you are not happy with the result, or something went wrong, you can undo this operation.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity_after_upgrade.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Keep in mind that you still need to update the source code, where references to the old trackers are used.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>Runtime Tracker</code> sample used to create a <code>ClientTracker</code> with a custom remote URL.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">GameObject trackerObject = new GameObject(&quot;ClientTracker&quot;);
_currentTracker = trackerObject.AddComponent&lt;ClientTracker&gt;();
_currentTracker.UseCustomUrl = true;
_currentTracker.TargetPath = Url.text;

_currentTracker.OnTrackerFinishedLoading.AddListener(OnTrackerFinishedLoading);
_currentTracker.OnTrackerLoadingError.AddListener(OnTrackerLoadingError);
</code></pre>
<p>Here is how the sample would look like when using the new <code>ImageTracker</code> and APIs.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">GameObject trackerObject = new GameObject(&quot;ImageTracker&quot;);
_currentTracker = trackerObject.AddComponent&lt;ImageTracker&gt;();
_currentTracker.TargetSourceType = TargetSourceType.TargetCollectionResource;
_currentTracker.TargetCollectionResource = new TargetCollectionResource();
_currentTracker.TargetCollectionResource.UseCustomURL = true;
_currentTracker.TargetCollectionResource.TargetPath = Url.text;

_currentTracker.TargetCollectionResource.OnFinishLoading.AddListener(OnFinishLoading);
_currentTracker.TargetCollectionResource.OnErrorLoading.AddListener(OnErrorLoading);

_currentTracker.OnTargetsLoaded.AddListener(OnTargetsLoaded);
_currentTracker.OnErrorLoadingTargets.AddListener(OnErrorLoadingTargets);
</code></pre>
<p>The old trackers are still kept for backwards compatibility, but will be removed in a future version, so please update to the new ones.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CloudTrackable was removed from the samples. If you are upgrading from an older version, please make sure that this script is no longer in your projects, otherwise you might encounter compilation errors.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-1-1-0-to-1-2-0">Migrate from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0</h2>
<p>Version 1.2.0 simplifies the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> prefab. It is now a single GameObject, without the hierarchy it previously had. If you had any changes to the prefab, except for the license key, please make sure to back it up first.</p>
<p>Because the previous hierarchy is gone, the camera feed is no longer explicitly exposed in the editor, but you can still access it through the <code>CameraTexture</code> property on the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> script.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-1-0-1-to-1-1-0">Migrate from 1.0.1 to 1.1.0</h2>
<p>Version 1.1.0 contains <strong>many breaking changes to the plugin</strong>, so before upgrading, please backup your project, to prevent accidentally losing your work.</p>
<p>Wikitude classes are now concrete and sealed and expose Unity events to communicate. This means that now you can add them directly to game objects and subscribe to their events through the editor or at runtime in code. When adding subscribers to events, make sure you use the dynamic version of your method, when there is a choice between static and dynamic (please see the <a href="clientrecognitionnative.html">Client Recognition</a> examples for more information on how to set up Client Trackers).</p>
<p>Values that were set in the inspector for these classes will need to be reset because of the change in class name and their internal representation.</p>
<p>The classes that previously derived from them will no longer work, so they need to be updated to receive events. On your game objects, you will get missing mono classes after updating. These should be replaced with the corresponding classes in the Wikitude plugin (Wikitude/Dependencies/WikitudeUnityPlugin) and the values need to be reintroduced.</p>
<p>All function names in Wikitude classes now begin with a capital letter.</p>
<p>When building for iOS, if you choose to append over a build made with a previous version, you will end up with two versions of the Wikitude plugin in your project, one located in Plugins/iOS and the new one in Plugins/Wikitude/iOS. Please make sure that only the new one is used. Alternatively, you can redo the build from scratch using the steps from the <a href="setupguideunity.html">Setup Guide</a> section.</p>
<h4 id="migration-example">Migration Example</h4>
<p>This section will show how to migrate the example project from version 1.0.1 to work with the new version of the plugin.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>(Optional)</code> Delete the <code>Dependencies</code>, <code>Editor</code> and <code>Plugins</code> folders. The plugin folder has changed drastically in this version. If you don&#39;t delete these folders, the correct files should still be replaced with the new version. However, the samples will not work correctly because magazine.wtc will be in <code>StreamingAssets</code> folder instead of <code>StreamingAssets/Wikitude</code>. Since we won&#39;t be using the samples in this example, this step can be skipped.</li>
<li>Delete the <code>Wikitude/Samples</code> folder. The <code>Samples</code> folder is for illustration purposes only and is not needed in development.</li>
<li>Update <code>ClientTracker</code> script. <code>Wikitude.IClientTracker</code> has been renamed to <code>Wikitude.ClientTracker</code> and is a sealed class. As such, the <code>ClientTracker</code> script should be changed to derive from <code>MonoBehaviour</code> instead and it&#39;s methods should be simple, instead of override. These methods will be set as callbacks in the Inspector. The class name should also be changed to avoid clashes with the Wikitude class.</li>
<li>Similar steps should be taken to update the <code>CloudTracker</code> script. Additionally, since it no longer derives from <code>Wikitude.CloudTracker</code>, it will need a reference to it so that it can call <code>StartContinuousRecognition</code>.</li>
<li>Similar steps should be taken to update the <code>SurferBehaviour</code> script.</li>
<li>Delete <code>MagazineTracker</code>, <code>TrackableBehaviour</code> and <code>WikitudeCamera</code> scripts. Since Wikitude classes are concrete now, they can be assigned directly to GameObjects, so there is no need for these empty classes anymore.</li>
<li>Open the scene called <code>main</code> from the <code>Scenes</code> folder.</li>
<li>Select the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> GameObject from the Hierarchy and enter your license key in the appropriate field in the Inspector. If the script is missing, add the <code>WikitudeCamera</code> script from the <code>Dependencies/WikitudeUnityPlugin</code> dll.</li>
<li>Create a new GameObject and add the script you updated at step 3 to it.</li>
<li>Select the <code>ClientTracker</code> GameObject from the Hierarchy and from the <code>Target Collection</code> dropdown select <code>magazine.wtc</code>. Then, for each event you want to subscribe to, press the plus sign, set the GameObject created at step 9 to the field <code>None (Object)</code> and select the corresponding function callback. Please see <a href="clientrecognitionnative.html">Client Recognition</a> examples for more information on how to work with Unity Events.</li>
<li>Select the <code>WikitudeEye</code> GameObject from the Hierarchy and add the script you updated at step 5 to it.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Trackable</code> GameObject from the Hierarchy and in the <code>Target Pattern</code> field enter * to track all targets. In the events foldout, subscribe the script you added to WikitudeEye to both <code>On Enter Field Of Vision</code> and <code>On Exit Field Of Vision</code> events.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project should now work as before.</p>

5.8    Third Party Software
5.8.1    The Wikitude SDK may be provided to You in a way that includes Third Party Software. If so, reference to such Third Party Software and the respective license provisions is included in the Product Description and/or in the technical documentation of the respective Product; all technical documentations can be found on the website of Wikitude. Third Party Software included in a Product for which You acquired a Commercial License shall never form an obstacle to commercial use of an application You created; You shall read and comply with the terms by the right holder(s) of such Third Party Software. 

5.8.2    The delivery of the Product does not convey a license, nor imply any rights, to use Third Party Software. You acknowledge and hereby accept that in some instances You may be required to obtain a separate license of the right holder(s) prior to using their Software and/or to making available Derivative Works into which their Software has been incorporated. You shall be solely responsible to verify whether You are required to obtain a license. If applicable, You shall be solely responsible to obtain such a license. 


6    PROVISION OF THE WIKITUDE SDK
6.1    You acknowledge and hereby accept that the nature and form of the Wikitude SDK may be subject to temporary and/or permanent changes without prior notice (including but not limited to updates, bug fixes and patches) and that future versions of the Wikitude SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous versions of the Wikitude SDK.

6.2    Wikitude reserves the right at any time and from time to time – at Wikitude’s sole discretion - to stop providing the Wikitude SDK, features within the Wikitude SDK, extensions, plugins or services to You or to any Third Party with or without prior notice.

6.3    You acknowledge and agree that Wikitude shall not be liable to You or to any Third Party for any modification of the nature and form of the Wikitude SDK or for stopping to provide the Wikitude SDK.

6.4    You understand that You have under no circumstances no legal Claim whatsoever by which Wikitude would be obliged to provide You with technical support concerning the Wikitude SDK and it’s parts, except explicitly stated otherwise in the Product Description or agreed individually in a separate written agreement.

7    CONFIDENTIALITY
7.1    Information You receive in the course of buying and using a Product and its components, in particular the Wikitude SDK, is considered confidential, including, but not limited to, information on content, functionality and range of functions of the Wikitude SDK. You shall treat all such information as confidential and transfer this confidentiality obligations to all Authorized Users. No confidential information may be disclosed to Third Parties without the prior written consent of Wikitude. 
7.2    The foregoing obligation, however, shall not apply to any part of the information that (i) has been disclosed in publicly available sources of information, (ii) is, through none of Your or Your Authorized Users’ fault, hereafter disclosed in publicly available sources of information, (iii) is now in Your possession without any obligation of confidentiality, or (iv) has been or is hereafter rightfully disclosed to You by a Third Party, but only to the extent that the use or disclosure thereof has been or is rightfully authorized by that Third Party. 

8    PRIVACY
8.1    You must comply with all Applicable Laws including all applicable privacy laws; and with Wikitude’s publicly disseminated Privacy Policy; and with all provisions of the „Google Analytics Terms of Service“ at any time. You shall be solely responsible to obtain all necessary consents and approvals of Your End Users. In particular You are responsible to provide End Users with all information required and to obtain all required consents in the required form under Applicable Law.

8.2    If Your Derivative Work is an application that collects, uses, processes, transmits and/or discloses End User Data, You represent and warrant that You will have obtained all necessary consents from the End user to the collection, use, processing, transmission and/or disclosure of such information. In addition, the use of location data should be limited solely as necessary to provide services or functionality for Your application (e.g., the use of collected personal information for marketing purposes is prohibited, unless permitted under Applicable Law and expressly consented to by the End User). If Your Derivative Work stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely.

8.3    Wikitude does not track individual usage of the applications (Derivative Works) You created unless the following constitutes such tracking under the Applicable Laws of the jurisdictions in which Your Derivative Works are made available to End Users. You acknowledge and hereby agree that Wikitude may anonymously track and report the distribution of Your Derivative Works through use of information set out in section 5.6.1. You must indicate to Your End Users, either in the app itself or in Your terms of service, that the distribution of Your application may be anonymously tracked and reported and You must provide such information to the users. If required by Applicable Law, You must obtain the End User’s consent hereto.

8.4    In particular if You intend to distribute or make available within the European Union Derivative Works that gain access to any other information stored in the mobile device of the End User than information technically required for the purpose of enabling You to provide a service requested by the End-User, You undertake to get the End User’s consent based on the required comprehensive information, including but not limited to the type of collected information, the purposes for which such information is being collected, the way it is being used and, if applicable the Third Parties to which such information will be transmitted. The aforesaid is applicable to any information irrespective of such information qualifying as “personal data” or not. You are aware that under the EU privacy regime You need to meet in particular the following requirements:

(a)    Ask for consent before the app starts to retrieve or place information on the device, i.e., before installation of the app. Such consent has to be freely given, specific and informed; 
(b)    ask for granular consent for each type of data the app will access; at least, if accessed, for the following categories: Location, Contacts, Unique Device Identifier, Identity of the data subject, Identity of the phone, Credit card and payment data, Telephony and SMS, Browsing history, Email, Social networks credentials and Biometrics; 
(c)    be aware that consent does not legitimize excessive or disproportionate data processing; 
(d)    provide well-defined and comprehensible purposes of the data processing in advance to installation of the app, and not change these purposes without renewed consent; 
(e)    provide comprehensive information if the data will be used for third party purposes, such as advertising or analytics; 
(f)    allow users to revoke their consent and uninstall the app, and delete data where appropriate; 
(g)    respect the principle of data minimization and only collect those data that are strictly necessary to perform the desired functionality; take the necessary organizational and technical measures to ensure the protection of the personal data You process, at all stages of the design and implementation of the application (privacy by design); 
(h)    provide a single point of contact for the users of the application. Provide a readable, understandable and easily accessible privacy policy that in particular fulfils the information duties set out in Art. 12 to 14 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR);
(i)    enable app users to exercise their rights as a data subject as defined in the Art. 15 et seq of the GDPR (in particular, access, rectification, erasure and their right to object to data processing) and inform them about the existence of these mechanisms;
(j)    define a reasonable retention period for data collected with the app and predefine a period of inactivity after which the account will be treated as expired; 
(k)    with regard to apps aimed at children: pay attention to the age limit defining children or minors in Art. 8 GDPR and in national legislation, choose the most restrictive data processing approach in full respect of the principles of data minimization and purpose limitation, refrain from processing children&#39;s data for behavioural advertising purposes, either directly or indirectly and refrain from collecting data through the children about their relatives and/or friends.

8.5    If any consent from the End User to the collection, use, processing, transmission and/or disclosure of such End User Data is denied or withdrawn, You may not collect, use, process, transmit and/or disclose the End User Data or perform any other actions for which the End Users consent has been denied or withdrawn.

9    WAIVER OF VOIDABILITY 
9.1    VOIDABILITY OF THE CONTRACT FOR MISTAKE  (MEANING THAT YOUR DECLARATION OF INTENT UPON ORDERING A PRODUCT, WAS GIVEN UNAWARE OR IN ERROR ABOUT ITS CONTENTS OR IN LACK OF INTENTION OF MAKING A DECLARATION WITH THIS CONTENT) IS EXCLUDED.

9.2    VOIDAVILITY FOR LAESIO ENORMIS (MEANING THAT THE VALUE OF THE ORDERED SERVICES IS LESS THAN HALF OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION) IS EXCLUDED.

13.1    The agreement between You and Wikitude which is concluded based on the Terms of Service is effective upon confirmation of acceptance of Your Product order by Wikitude. Belated request of the license key by You or belated receipt of the license key due to belated payment by You will not extend the term of Your License. 

13.2    Licenses granted to You by Wikitude free of charge shall remain in full force and effect for the period of time indicated in the Product Description unless terminated earlier by either party. Termination is possible for either party at any time.

16.3    The failure of any party at any time to enforce or require performance of any provision hereof shall in no way operate as a waiver or affect the right of such party at a later time to enforce the same. Any waiver of an obligation, agreement or condition contained herein shall be valid and effective only if in writing and signed by the party to whom such compliance is owed. No such waiver shall be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent breach, Claim or failure to perform, or of any obligation, agreement or condition other than the one expressly waived.

16.4    If any provision of the Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable, the provision will be construed to reflect the party’s original intent.
